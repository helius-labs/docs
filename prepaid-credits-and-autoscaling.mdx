## How to Get Additional Credits

If your credits run out during your billing cycle, you can get more credits by either **purchasing prepaid credits** if you paid via crypto, or **enabling autoscaling** if you paid by card.

### 1. Prepaid Credits (Crypto Plans)

If you're on a Crypto Plan, you can quickly purchase additional prepaid credits directly from your Helius Dashboard:

* Log into your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/).
* Select **Buy More Credits**.
* Complete the purchase with your preferred crypto payment method.

<Note>
Prepaid credits activate immediately and never expire—you keep them until they run out.
</Note>

### 2. Autoscaling (Card Payment Plans)

Autoscaling automatically adds credits as you use them, ensuring uninterrupted service:

* Go to your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/) and select your project.
* Navigate to **Project Settings**.
* Enable the **Autoscaling** toggle.

Once enabled, Helius will automatically allocate more credits as your usage increases.

<Note>
Autoscaling is capped for Developer and Business plans to help manage costs and avoid unexpected charges. If you require unlimited autoscaling, consider upgrading to the **Professional** plan.
</Note>
### Pricing for Additional Credits

Additional credit pricing depends on your current plan:

| Plan Type    | Price per Million Additional Credits |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Developer    | $5 per million                       |
| Business     | $5 per million                       |
| Professional | $4 per million                       |

If you're consistently going over your limit, consider upgrading your plan for better rates and unlimited autoscaling.

### Notifications and Tracking Credit Usage

Helius keeps you informed about your credit usage to help manage your spend:

* **Email Alerts**: You'll receive notifications via email when you're approaching your credit limits and when autoscaling occurs.
* **Dashboard Tracking**: Check your current credit usage and historical data directly from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/). Navigate to the **Usage** section to see detailed analytics.

### Autoscaling Limits and Enterprise Options

* **Developer and Business plans**: Autoscaling is available but has predefined caps to avoid unexpectedly large bills.
* **Professional plans**: Autoscaling is unlimited—ideal for rapidly scaling projects.
* **Enterprise plans**: For credit needs exceeding 1B/month, set up an Enterprise plan tailored to your requirements.
