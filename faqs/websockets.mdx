## Billing and Rate Limits

<Accordion title="How many credits does WebSocket events consume?">
WebSocket events do not consume credits. Both standard WebSockets and Enhanced WebSockets are included with your plan without additional credit costs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much faster are Enhanced Websockets vs. normal WebSockets?">
Enhanced WebSockets are, on average, 1.5x - 2x faster than standard WebSockets. They provide faster response times through optimized infrastructure and direct access to Helius's streaming backend, making them ideal for high-performance applications requiring low-latency data.
</Accordion>

## Disconnects and Retries

<Accordion title="Why are my Enhanced WebSockets connections disconnecting?">
Enhanced WebSockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer that disconnects idle connections. To prevent disconnections:

1. **Implement health checks**: Send pings every minute to keep connections alive
2. **Add reconnection logic**: Automatically reconnect when disconnections occur
3. **Use proper connection management**: Follow the patterns shown in our [Enhanced WebSockets documentation](/enhanced-websockets/transaction-subscribe)

Implement reconnection and ping logic as shown in our documentation, then add your application logic on top of this foundation.
</Accordion>

## Using WebSockets

<Accordion title="How do I subscribe to full transactions using WebSockets?">
**For Enhanced WebSockets**, set `transactionDetails: "full"` in your subscription options:

```javascript
const subscriptionRequest = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: 1,
  method: "transactionSubscribe",
  params: [
    {
      accountInclude: ["YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"],
      failed: false,
      vote: false
    },
    {
      commitment: "confirmed",
      encoding: "jsonParsed",
      transactionDetails: "full",  // Full transaction details
      maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 0
    }
  ]
};
```

**For Standard WebSockets**, use `logsSubscribe` or `signatureSubscribe` methods depending on your monitoring needs. See our [WebSocket guide](/rpc/websocket) for detailed examples of each subscription type.
