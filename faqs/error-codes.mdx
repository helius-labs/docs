## Common Error Codes

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 401 error?">
401 errors indicate authentication issues. Check that your API key is correct, properly included in your request (as `?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`), and that your account has access to the endpoint you're trying to use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 429 error?">
429 errors mean you've exceeded your rate limits. Check your [plans and rate limits](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/plans-and-rate-limits) and consider upgrading your plan or implementing request throttling in your application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 500 error?">
500 errors are internal server errors. Check our [status page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for any ongoing incidents. If the issue persists, [contact support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support) with your request details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 503 error?">
503 errors indicate the service is temporarily unavailable, often due to high load or maintenance. Check our [status page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for updates and try again after a brief delay.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 504 error?">
504 errors are gateway timeouts, typically caused by requests taking too long to process. Consider reducing the scope of your request, using pagination, or optimizing your query parameters.
</Accordion>
