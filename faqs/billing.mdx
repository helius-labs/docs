## Refunds

<Accordion title="My plan auto-renewed. Can I get a refund?">
We're unable to offer refunds on automated subscription renewals if you've already used the service. This follows the standard practice on most platforms.
</Accordion>

## Payment Methods

<Accordion title="I want to switch between fiat and crypto payments.">
Contact [Support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support) and we'll handle the change for you.
</Accordion>

## Crypto Payments

<Accordion title="What does 'Authorize Automatic Withdrawals' mean?">
• Helius pulls the required USDC from your Solana wallet at the start of each billing cycle.

• The charge succeeds only if your wallet holds enough USDC.

• You can revoke the authorization any time in your wallet or in **Billing → Manage Authorization Limit**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I manually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing payments?">
Manual payments aren't supported. You can, however, revoke the authorization right after each charge by setting the limit to 0 under **Manage Authorization Limit**.
</Accordion>
