## Refunds

<Accordion title="My plan auto-renewed. Can I get a refund?">
We're unable to offer refunds on automated subscription renewals if you've already used the service. This follows the standard practice on most platforms.
</Accordion>

## Payment Methods

<Accordion title="I want to switch between fiat and crypto payments.">
Contact [Support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support) and we'll handle the change for you.
</Accordion>

## Crypto Payments

<Accordion title="What does 'Authorize Automatic Withdrawals' mean?">
• Helius pulls the required USDC from your Solana wallet at the start of each billing cycle.

• The charge succeeds only if your wallet holds enough USDC.

• You can revoke the authorization any time in your wallet or in [**Billing**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) → **Manage Authorization Limit**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I manually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing payments?">
Manual payments aren't supported. You can, however, revoke the authorization right after each charge by setting the limit to 0 under **Manage Authorization Limit**.
</Accordion>

## Authorization Management

<Accordion title="What does the authorization duration affect?">
The authorization duration (in months) determines how much USDC you pre-authorize for automatic subscription payments:

**Longer duration**: Higher authorization limit, fewer wallet interactions needed
**Shorter duration**: Lower authorization limit, more control over payments

The system calculates: Monthly cost × Duration = New authorization limit

You can adjust this anytime, and payments will automatically be deducted from your authorized amount on billing days until the limit is reached.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I manage my authorization limits?">
You can manage your authorization limit by clicking **Manage authorization limit** on the [billing](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) page. This allows you to:

• Select the authorization duration (3, 6, or 12 months) using the radio buttons
• See the calculated new limit based on your subscription cost and duration  
• Update the limit by clicking **Update Limit**

The authorization limit determines the maximum amount that can be automatically withdrawn from your wallet for subscription payments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I have the wrong wallet connected when trying to manage authorization limits">
If you see that the "Currently connected" wallet doesn't match the "Required payment wallet":

1. Click **Switch Wallet** in the authorization management modal
2. Disconnect your current wallet and connect the required payment wallet shown in the modal
3. Once the correct wallet is connected, you'll be able to manage your authorization limits

Each project's authorization limits can only be managed by the specific wallet that was used to set up payments for that project.
</Accordion>
