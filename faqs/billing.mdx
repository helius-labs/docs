## Purchasing Plans

<Accordion title="What are the limitations of Helius's Free Plan?">
The free plan includes limited credits and request rates suitable for development and testing. For production applications, consider a paid plan for higher limits, staked connections, and enhanced APIs. See our [pricing page](https://www.helius.dev/pricing) for detailed comparisons.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I pay for my subscription?">
We accept both traditional payment methods (credit cards) and cryptocurrency (USDC on Solana). You can set up payment during plan selection or change payment methods in your [billing dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why hasn't my paid plan appeared in my dashboard yet?">
Updates may take up to an hour. If nothing changes after that, please reach out to [Support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I'm subscribed to a plan, but my payment method fails?">
If payment fails, you'll receive notifications and have a grace period to update your payment method. Your service may be temporarily downgraded to free tier limits until payment is resolved. Update payment details in your [billing dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing).
</Accordion>

## Paying with Crypto

<Accordion title="How can I change my payment method from credit card to crypto (or the other way around)?">
Contact [Support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support) and we'll help you transition.
</Accordion>



<Accordion title="What does 'Authorize Automatic Withdrawals' mean?">
• Helius pulls the required USDC from your Solana wallet at the start of each billing cycle.

• The charge succeeds only if your wallet holds enough USDC.

• You can revoke the authorization any time in your wallet or in [**Billing**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) → **Manage Authorization Limit**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I manually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing withdrawals?">
Manual payments aren't supported. You can, however, revoke the authorization right after each charge by setting the limit to 0 under [**Manage Authorization Limit**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing).
</Accordion>

## Upgrades

<Accordion title="How do I upgrade my plan?">
You can upgrade your plan anytime from the [**Helius Dashboard**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you offer custom solutions?">
Yes! We offer custom enterprise solutions with dedicated infrastructure, custom rate limits, and specialized support. [Contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ) for personalized options.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I upgrade to an Enterprise plan?">
Enterprise plans are custom-built for your needs. [Contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ) to discuss your requirements and get a personalized quote.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does an Enterprise plan include?">
Enterprise plans include custom request limits, dedicated infrastructure, priority support, custom billing terms, SLAs, and specialized features tailored to your organization's needs.
</Accordion>

## Downgrades

<Accordion title="How do I downgrade my plan?">
You can downgrade your plan from the [billing dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If I downgrade my crypto subscription, when will it go into effect?">
Crypto downgrades happen immediately. You'll receive a prorated credit as a discount on your next subscription billing cycle for the unused portion of your current plan.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I cancel my subscription?">
You can cancel your subscription from the [billing dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing). Your service will continue until the end of your current billing period, then revert to free tier limits.
</Accordion>

## Autscaling

<Accordion title="How do I enable autoscaling?">
Enable autoscaling in your [project settings](https://dashboard.helius.dev/settings) under the autoscaling section. This automatically purchases additional credits when you exceed your plan limits. See our [autoscaling guide](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/autoscaling) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why did I get an invoice for overages when I enabled autoscaling?">
Autoscaling purchases additional credits when you exceed your plan limits, which appear as overages on your invoice. This is expected behavior - autoscaling prevents service interruption by automatically buying the credits you need.
</Accordion>

## Overages

<Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my credit limit?">
If you exceed your credit limit, you can enable autoscaling or purchase additional prepaid credits. Learn more on the [**Additional Credits**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/autoscaling) page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my project consuming credits even though I'm not using any Helius endpoints?">
Check for active webhooks, automated scripts, or background processes that might be making API calls. Review your [usage dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/usage) to identify the source of credit consumption.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my usage increasing when I haven't changed anything?">
Your API key may have been compromised, or a webhook might be running in the background. To resolve this:

1. Delete the current API key and create a new one.
2. Check your webhooks from the dashboard and disable any that shouldn't be active.
3. If the issue persists, contact support for assistance.

To help prevent key leaks in the future, consider setting up a proxy as described in [this guide](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/protect-your-keys).
</Accordion>

## Refunds

<Accordion title="Can I get a refund if my plan was accidently auto-renewed?">
We're unable to offer refunds on automated subscription renewals if you've already used the service. This follows the standard practice on most platforms.
</Accordion>
