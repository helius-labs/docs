## Purchasing LaserStream

<Accordion title="How is LaserStream better than a dedicated gRPC node?">
It spans seven regions, auto‑fails over with replay, and is a drop‑in replacement for Geyser. So you get higher throughput and resilience compared to dedicated nodes. For more info, check our [comparison](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream/laserstream-vs-dedicated-nodes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the LaserStream 50 TB add‑on and how much does it cost?">
For **$2,500 / month** on a Professional plan, you get 50 TB of unmetered data (no credits consumed). After that, additional data costs **2 credits per 0.1 MB**—a 33% discount versus the standard rate.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting LaserStream

<Accordion title="I'm experiencing lag or slow performance with my LaserStream connection, what could be causing this?">
• **Client‑side bottlenecks**: JavaScript clients can lag when overwhelmed. Narrow your filters or switch to a faster language.

• **Limited local bandwidth**: Heavy subscriptions can saturate a slow link. Monitor network usage or upgrade your connection.

• **Geographic distance**: Pick the region‑nearest LaserStream endpoint; long routes drop packets and add latency.

• **Processing logic**: Avoid blocking the main thread; use async queues or workers.

*Benchmark tip*:

```bash
cargo install helius-laserstream-bandwidth
helius-laserstream-bandwidth --laserstream-url $LASERSTREAM_URL --api-key $API_KEY
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm getting connection errors, what should I check?">
Verify your x-token and endpoint, make sure outbound gRPC is allowed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why aren't my filters working as expected?">
Confirm public keys and commitment levels, and review your `AND`/`OR` logic. Filters are evaluated as described in the [docs](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream/grpc#subscribe-request).
</Accordion>

## Subscriptions & Filters

<Accordion title="Can I subscribe to multiple data types in one request (e.g., accounts and transactions)?">
Yes, add separate filter configs (such as `accounts` and `transactions`) in a single `SubscribeRequest`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the practical filter limits?">
Up to **10 million** account includes per stream, unlimited program filters, and **100 concurrent connections** per project.
</Accordion>

## Monitoring & Metrics

<Accordion title="Where do I find LaserStream bandwidth metrics?">
You can find it on the [LaserStream](https://dashboard.helius.dev/laserstream) page in the Helius Dashboard.
