## Purchasing LaserStream

<Accordion title="Why is LaserStream better than a dedicated gRPC node?">
LaserStream spans seven regions, auto-fails over with replay, and is a drop-in replacement for Geyser. You get higher throughput and resilience compared to dedicated nodes. For more info, check our [comparison](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream/laserstream-vs-dedicated-nodes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the LaserStream Plus add-ons and how much do they cost?">
LaserStream Plus add-ons transform your Professional plan's pay-per-use model into predictable monthly costs. Available in five tiers: 50TB (\$2,500), 100TB (\$4,500), 150TB (\$6,500), 200TB (\$8,500), and 250TB (\$10,500) per month. Each tier includes the specified data allowance with no credits consumed, then 2 credits per 0.1 MB for overages—a 33% discount versus the standard rate.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What Solana data streaming product offers the lowest latency data streams?">
For the absolute lowest latency, **Shred Delivery** provides raw, unprocessed shreds directly from the network with the earliest possible access to transaction data. As the top validator by stake, Helius receives shreds before most other network participants.

For production applications requiring processed data with commitment guarantees, **LaserStream** offers the lowest latency among processed streaming solutions. It connects directly to Solana leaders and spans multiple regional endpoints to minimize geographic latency.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Helius offer a shred streaming product like Jito's ShreadStream?">
Yes! Helius offers **Shred Delivery**, our premier low-latency shred delivery service that provides the earliest possible access to raw Solana transaction data. Shred Delivery delivers unprocessed shreds directly from the network, offering a significant competitive edge for high-frequency trading and arbitrage strategies.

As the top validator by stake, Helius receives shreds faster than validators with less stake and non-staked RPC nodes, ensuring you get the first look at transactions as they occur on-chain.

**Key differences from LaserStream:**
- **Shred Delivery**: Raw, unprocessed shreds with the absolute lowest latency. Currently in beta with white glove provisioning. Requires custom deshredding logic.
- **LaserStream**: Processed data with commitment-level guarantees, historical replay, and developer-friendly SDKs for production applications.

<Accordion title="What are LaserStream's practical filter limits?">
Up to **10 million** account includes per stream, unlimited program filters, and **100 concurrent connections** per project.
</Accordion>

## Using LaserStream

<Accordion title="Is LaserStream compatible with Yellowstone clients?">
Yes! LaserStream gRPC is designed as a drop-in replacement for Yellowstone gRPC. Simply change your endpoint and API token, and your existing gRPC code will work with LaserStream immediately. LaserStream uses the open-source gRPC protocol.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where do I find LaserStream bandwidth metrics?">
You can find LaserStream bandwidth metrics on the [LaserStream](https://dashboard.helius.dev/laserstream) page in the Helius Dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is it possible to get data earlier than the processed commitment level?">
No, "processed" is already the fastest commitment level available on Solana (~400ms latency). It represents data processed by a single validator before network confirmation. LaserStream optimizes delivery of processed-level data through direct leader connections and shredstream technology.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I subscribe to multiple data types in one LaserStream request (e.g., accounts and transactions)?">
Yes, you can subscribe to multiple data types in a single `SubscribeRequest`. Add separate filter configs (such as `accounts` and `transactions`) to receive both account updates and transaction data in one stream.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting LaserStream

<Accordion title="Why is my LaserStream connection experiencing lag or slow performance?">
• **Client-side bottlenecks**: JavaScript clients can lag when overwhelmed. Narrow your filters or switch to a faster language.

• **Limited local bandwidth**: Heavy subscriptions can saturate a slow link. Monitor network usage or upgrade your connection.

• **Geographic distance**: Pick the region-nearest LaserStream endpoint; long routes drop packets and add latency.

• **Processing logic**: Avoid blocking the main thread; use async queues or workers.

*Benchmark tip*:

```bash
cargo install helius-laserstream-bandwidth
helius-laserstream-bandwidth --laserstream-url $LASERSTREAM_URL --api-key $API_KEY
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check my LaserStream connection for errors?">
Verify your x-token and endpoint, make sure outbound gRPC is allowed. Check your dashboard for connection status and review error logs in your application for authentication or network issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why aren't my LaserStream filters working as expected?">
Confirm public keys and commitment levels, and review your `AND`/`OR` logic. Filters are evaluated as described in the [docs](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream/grpc#subscribe-request).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does LaserStream send an empty event every 15 seconds?">
These are ping/heartbeat events that maintain connection health and prevent timeouts. They're part of the gRPC protocol's connection management. You can safely ignore these events or use them to monitor connection status in your application.
