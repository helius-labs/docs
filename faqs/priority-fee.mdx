## Using the Priority Fee API

<Accordion title="How do I improve the landing rate for my transactions with low fees?">
Use the [Priority Fee API](/priority-fee-api) to get optimal fee recommendations instead of guessing fees. Choose appropriate priority levels ("Medium" for most cases, "High" for time-sensitive operations) and follow transaction best practices.

For paid plans, staked connections provide near-guaranteed delivery when combined with proper priority fees.

See our [Transaction Optimization Guide](/sending-transactions/optimizing-transactions) for complete implementation details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I send a transaction on Solana?">
Helius provides three main approaches:

1. **Smart Transactions** (Recommended) - Use our [SDKs](/sdks) for automatic optimization
2. **Manual Optimization** - Build and optimize transactions yourself with full control  
3. **Ultra-Low Latency** - Use [Helius Sender](/sending-transactions/sender) for high-frequency trading

See our [Sending Transactions Overview](/sending-transactions/overview) to choose the right method and [Manual Transaction Sending](/sending-transactions/send-manually) for step-by-step implementation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What priority level should I use for my transactions?">
**Start with "Medium"** for most applications. Use "High" or "VeryHigh" for time-sensitive operations, and "Low" for cost-optimized non-urgent transactions.

See the [Priority Fee API guide](/priority-fee-api) for detailed explanations of all six priority levels and when to use each.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I calculate the total cost of priority fees?">
**Formula**: Total priority fee = Price per compute unit × Compute units consumed

Use the [Priority Fee API](/priority-fee-api) to get real time estimates for your specific transaction instead of manual calculations. The API accounts for current network conditions and transaction complexity.
