## Billing and Rate Limits

<Accordion title="Why do I get rate limited for getProgramAccounts below my plan's rate limit?">
`getProgramAccounts` is a resource-intensive method that have an additional rate limiting beyond standard requests per second. Consider filtering parameters, or breaking large queries into smaller chunks to stay within [limits](/billing/plans-and-rate-limits#high-complexity-calls).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get a specific region for my RPC endpoint?">
Helius automatically routes requests to the optimal region for performance. For specialized regional requirements or dedicated infrastructure, [contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ) to discuss enterprise options.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting RPCs

<Accordion title="Why aren't my sendTransaction requests landing?">
Call the **Priority Fee API**, optimize compute-unit usage, and send the transaction with `skipPreflight: true`. See our [**Transaction Optimization Guide**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/sending-transactions/optimizing-transactions) for a step-by-step walkthrough.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I suddenly seeing 5xx errors?">
Check our [status page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for relevant updates. If there's no related incident, contact [support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support).
</Accordion>

## Using RPCs

<Accordion title="What is the best practice for getting the latest blockhash?">
Use `getLatestBlockhash` with `"confirmed"` commitment level for the most recent blockhash. Always fetch a fresh blockhash before submitting transactions to ensure validity. See our [getLatestBlockhash guide](/rpc/guides/getlatestblockhash) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are staked connections?">
Staked connections route your transactions directly to current and upcoming block leaders, bypassing public queues for near-guaranteed delivery. All paid plans automatically use staked connections by default - no code changes required. Learn more in our [transaction sending overview](/sending-transactions/overview#staked-vs-unstaked-connections).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How far back can I access historical data using standard RPC calls?">
Standard RPC plans provide access to all historical Solana data. Dedicated nodes only maintain ~48 hours of history.
