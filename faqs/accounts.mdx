## Account Management

<Accordion title="How do I get my Project ID?">
You can find your Project ID in the top left corner of the [**Helius Dashboard**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/project-settings).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are my rate limits?">
API usage follows Helius's standard rate-limiting. See the [**Plans & Rate limits**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/plans-and-rate-limits) page for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many credits does each call cost?">
A detailed list of calls and their credit costs is available [here](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/plans-and-rate-limits).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my credit limit?">
If you exceed your credit limit, you can enable autoscaling or purchase additional prepaid credits. Learn more on the [**Additional Credits**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/autoscaling) page.
</Accordion>

## API Key Management

<Accordion title="Why is my usage increasing when I haven't changed anything?">
Your API key may have been compromised, or a webhook might be running in the background. To resolve this:

1. Delete the current API key and create a new one.
2. Check your webhooks from the dashboard and disable any that shouldn't be active.
3. If the issue persists, contact support for assistance.

To help prevent key leaks in the future, consider setting up a proxy as described in [this guide](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/protect-your-keys).
