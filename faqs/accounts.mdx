## Managing Projects

<Accordion title="How do I get my Project ID?">
You can find your Project ID in the top left corner of the [**Helius Dashboard**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/project-settings).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="In the Dashboard, how is 'Successful Requests' different from 'Successful Requests Including Batch'?">
"Successful Requests" shows individual API calls, while "Successful Requests Including Batch" includes batch operations where multiple requests are processed together (like `getAssetBatch` or `getMultipleAccounts`). Batch operations count each individual request within the batch toward the total.
</Accordion>

## Credits

<Accordion title="How many credits does each call cost?">
A detailed list of calls and their credit costs is available [here](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/credits).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over to the next month?">
No, unused credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle. Credits reset monthly based on your subscription plan. Consider enabling [autoscaling](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/autoscaling) if you frequently exceed your plan limits.
</Accordion>

## Rate Limits

<Accordion title="What are my plans rate limits?">
API usage follows Helius's standard rate-limiting. See the [**Rate limits**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/rate-limits) page for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I get rate limited at a low rate even though I have a paid plan?">
Rate limiting can occur due to several factors: exceeding your plan's requests per second limit, making requests from too many concurrent connections, or hitting method-specific limits. Check your [dashboard usage](https://dashboard.helius.dev/usage) and ensure you're distributing requests appropriately. See the [**Rate limits**](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/rate-limits) page for rate limits.
</Accordion>

## Faucets

<Accordion title="How do I get Devnet SOL?">
Use the [Devnet faucet](https://dashboard.helius.dev/faucet) in your Helius Dashboard (requires a paid plan) or use the Solana CLI: `solana airdrop 1` while connected to your Helius Devnet endpoint. See our [Devnet SOL guide](/rpc/devnet-sol) for detailed instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the maximum amount of Devnet SOL I can request per day?">
The standard limit is typically 1 SOL per request with reasonable daily limits. If you need larger amounts for testing, [contact support](/support/contact-support) with details about your testing requirements.
</Accordion>
