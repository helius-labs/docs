## API Key Management

<Accordion title="Why is my usage increasing when I haven't changed anything?">
Your API key may have been compromised, or a webhook might be running in the background. To resolve this:

1. Delete the current API key and create a new one.
2. Check your webhooks from the dashboard and disable any that shouldn't be active.
3. If the issue persists, contact support for assistance.

To help prevent key leaks in the future, consider setting up a proxy as described in [this guide](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/protect-your-keys).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I rotate my dedicated node's API key?">
Yes—provide your host ID and [support](https://www.helius.dev/docs/support) team will provision a new key.
