## Using Sender

<Accordion title="What is Sender and why is it faster than other transaction sending services?">
Sender is a specialized service for ultra-low latency transaction submission. It optimizes transaction latency by sending to both Solana validators and [Jito](https://docs.jito.wtf/) simultaneously, providing multiple pathways for your transactions to be included in blocks.

With seven regional endpoints, typical land-time is ≤ 1.5 slots.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get a higher Sender API limit than 6 transactions per second (TPS)?">
Yes! While the standard limit is 6 TPS per region, you can request higher limits. [Contact support](/support/contact-support) to discuss custom rate limits based on your specific use case requirements. Higher limits are available for applications with demonstrated need for increased throughput.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I set tips and priority fees with Sender?">
All transactions sent through Sender must include both tips and priority fees for optimal performance:

**Tips**: Minimum 0.001 SOL is required for Jito auction participation. Tips enable access to Jito's MEV infrastructure and auction-based transaction inclusion.

**Priority Fees**: Use `ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitPrice` to prioritize your transaction in the validator queue. Use the [Priority Fee API](/priority-fee-api) for real-time fee recommendations.

**Why both are required**: Tips give you access to Jito's MEV auction, while priority fees improve your transaction's priority with validators—together they maximize inclusion probability.

See the [Sender documentation](/sending-transactions/sender) for detailed code examples and implementation guidelines.
