## Credits and Rate Limits

<Accordion title="How many addresses can I input for 1 webhook?">
Up to 100,000 addresses using the [API](/api-reference/webhooks/create-webhook).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will I be charged credits if I change the webhook URL in the Helius dashboard after creating the webhook?">
Yes, editing a webhook via the API or dashboard costs 100 credits per request. This applies to any modification including URL changes, adding/removing addresses, or updating transaction types.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many credits does it cost to receive a webhook notification?">
Each webhook event costs 1 credit when Helius processes and sends the event to your endpoint. You are charged regardless of whether your endpoint successfully processes the webhook or returns an error.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does it cost to create, edit, and delete webhooks?">
All webhook management operations (create, edit, delete) cost 100 credits per request when performed via the API. This covers the processing required to update your webhook configurations.
</Accordion>

## Supported Networks

<Accordion title="Are webhooks available on Solana Devnet?">
Yes. If you create a webhook through the UI, choose “devnet” as “Network”. If you create it through the Webhook API, set the “webhookType” parameter to "rawDevnet", "enhancedDevnet" or “discordDevnet” depending on your desired webhook type.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I input 'localhost' for my webhook URL?">
No—the URL must be publicly reachable over HTTPS. Helius cannot access local development servers via localhost URLs.
</Accordion>

## Using Webhooks

<Accordion title="How can I verify that the webhook came from Helius?">
Set an authorization header when creating or updating the webhook. Helius echoes this value in the `Authorization` header when sending data to your webhook endpoint, allowing you to verify the request's authenticity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between 'raw' and 'enhanced' webhooks?">
**Raw webhooks** return regular Solana transaction data directly from the blockchain. When a transaction occurs for the monitored addresses, the raw transaction data is sent to your webhook URL.

**Enhanced webhooks** provide Helius' interpreted transaction types. We parse over 100 types of Solana transactions (NFT listings, DeFi swaps, transfers, etc.) and abstract them into our own schema.

Use raw webhooks if you want all transaction data without abstractions, or enhanced webhooks if you want built-in transaction type detection and parsing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When does the Webhook send a notification?">
Webhooks send notifications immediately after a matching transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.
</Accordion>

## Retries

<Accordion title="What is the retry policy for webhooks?">
Helius retries unacknowledged webhook events up to 3 times with a 1-minute interval between attempts. We also offer customizable retry policies for enterprise plans.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do webhooks post failed transactions?">
It depends on the webhook type. Enhanced webhooks do not send failed transactions, but raw webhooks do include both successful and failed transactions.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Webhooks

<Accordion title="Why is my webhook dropping data?">
Data dropping typically occurs when your endpoint encounters an error, causing webhook retries that eventually fail and lead to data loss. Check your webhook logs in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/webhooks), ensure sufficient client-side logging is in place, and [contact support](/support/contact-support) if the problem persists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why aren't my webhooks working?">
Ensure the selected transaction type matches the transactions you're monitoring. Start with the "ANY" transaction type to identify if it's a general issue or a type mismatch. Use [webhook.site](http://webhook.site/) to test if the problem lies with your endpoint configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does my webhook not send me all transactions of a certain type (such as TOKEN_MINT)?">
The `TOKEN_MINT` webhook only triggers for specific programs like Candy Machine V1, and Solana Program Library. It doesn't cover all token minting events across the entire blockchain. For broader monitoring, consider using a more general account or program subscription via webhooks with "ANY" transaction type filtering.
</Accordion>
