<Info>
**MEV Protection**: Your transaction executes first in bundles and MEV is extracted after execution, reducing harmful MEV attacks while letting you profit from arbitrage opportunities you create.
</Info>

## What Is Backrunning?

Backrunning is a **beneficial form of arbitrage** that helps keep prices consistent across different exchanges. Unlike malicious MEV attacks, backrunning **improves the network** by correcting price imbalances created by large trades.

### How It Actually Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="When Someone Buys BONK (Big Trade)">
    **Price impact occurs**: The large buy pushes BONK's price up on that specific DEX (e.g., Raydium)

    **Price discrepancy created**: BONK is now more expensive on Raydium than on other exchanges like Orca

    **Backrun bot's strategy**:
    - Buy BONK cheaply on the exchange where price hasn't moved yet (Orca)
    - Sell BONK at the higher price on the exchange where the big trade occurred (Raydium)
    - Capture the price difference as profit

    **Result**: Prices across all exchanges quickly balance out, benefiting everyone
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="When Someone Sells BONK (Big Trade)">
    **Price drops**: The large sell pushes BONK's price down on one DEX

    **Arbitrage opportunity**: BONK is now cheaper on that exchange

    **Bot's response**:
    - Buy BONK at the lower price on the affected exchange
    - Sell BONK at the higher price on other exchanges where price hasn't adjusted yet

    **Result**: The price difference disappears, minimizing price discrepancies across markets
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Why This Helps Everyone**: Backrunning creates efficient price discovery and reduces slippage for future traders. Instead of letting this value go to random bots, Helius lets you earn from the arbitrage opportunities your own trades create.
</Note>

## What Are Backrun Rebates?

Helius Backrun Rebates let you earn a share of the MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) your transactions create. When your trade generates profitable arbitrage opportunities, searchers compete to backrun your transaction - and you get paid a portion of their profits in SOL.

    No sandwiching or frontrunning possible - your transaction executes first and is never revealed publicly beforehand

    Add `rebate-address` to your RPC URL - no code changes or contract modifications needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

The rebate system operates through an order-flow auction that runs alongside your normal transaction processing:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Opt In">
    Add `rebate-address=<YOUR_SOL_ADDRESS>` query parameter to any `sendTransaction` call on mainnet
  </Step>
      <Step title="Auction Process">
      Helius forwards an unsigned copy of your transaction to our order-flow auction where pre-approved, KYC'd searchers bid to backrun your trade
    </Step>
  <Step title="Bundle Creation">
    The highest bidder wins and a bundle is created: **[your transaction, searcher transaction]**. Your transaction is always executed first
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Payout">
    If the bundle lands on-chain, Helius automatically pays the agreed rebate directly to your specified address in SOL
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="How much can I earn?" icon="question">
  **You earn 50% of the MEV your trade creates**
  
  - Larger trades with higher price impact generate more MEV and higher rebates
  - Payments are immediate - you receive SOL in the same block as execution

## How Helius Protects You

Your transaction is only shared with vetted searchers in a private auction. No other parties can see or modify your transaction before execution. Helius only permits searchers engaging in post-trade backruns.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MEV?">
    MEV is Maximal Extractable Value. It's the profit validators can make by reordering transactions in blocks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do bundles work?">
    Your transaction goes to a private auction with pre-approved, KYC'd searchers who can only engage in post-trade backruns. The winning searcher's transaction is bundled with yours - your transaction executes first, then theirs. If the bundle succeeds, you automatically receive your SOL rebate in the same block.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much will I earn?">
    You earn 50% of the MEV your transaction creates. Helius keeps 50% for providing the infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When do I get paid?">
    Rebates are paid automatically in SOL in the same block as your transaction.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is this safe?">
    Yes. Your transaction executes first in bundles and is never exposed publicly, making frontrunning impossible.
