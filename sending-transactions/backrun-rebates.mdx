description: "Earn automatic SOL rebates when your transactions create arbitrage opportunities. Zero risk, maximum upside with one URL parameter."

<Info>
**No Sandwiching or Frontrunning Risk**: Your transaction is never revealed publicly before execution and always executes first in the bundle. This system eliminates MEV attacks against you while letting you profit from the MEV you create. All bundle executions are verifiable on-chain.
</Info>

## What Are Backrun Rebates?

Helius Backrun Rebates let you earn a share of the MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) your transactions create. When your trade generates profitable arbitrage opportunities, searchers compete to backrun your transaction - and you get paid a portion of their profits in SOL.

## How It Works

The rebate system operates through an order-flow auction that runs alongside your normal transaction processing:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Opt In">
    Add `rebate-address=<YOUR_SOL_ADDRESS>` query parameter to any `sendTransaction` call on mainnet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auction Process">
    Helius forwards a copy of your signed transaction to our order-flow auction where searchers bid to backrun your trade
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bundle Creation">
    The highest bidder wins and a bundle is created: **[your transaction, searcher transaction]**. Your transaction is always executed first
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Payout">
    If the bundle lands on-chain, Helius automatically pays the agreed rebate directly to your specified address in SOL
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="How much can I earn?" icon="question">
  **You earn 50% of the MEV your trade creates**
  
  - Larger trades with higher price impact generate more MEV and higher rebates
  - Payments are immediate - you receive SOL in the same block as execution

### How Bundles Work

<Steps titleSize="h4">
  <Step title="Your Transaction Submitted">
    You send your transaction with the `rebate-address` parameter to Helius
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auction Process">
    Searchers compete by bidding on the right to backrun your transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Winner Selected">
    The highest bidder wins and their transaction is bundled with yours
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bundle Creation">
    A bundle is created: **[Your TX → Searcher TX]** - your transaction always executes first
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validator Submission">
    The bundle is submitted to Solana validators for inclusion in a block
  </Step>
  <Step title="Atomic Execution">
    Either both transactions succeed or both fail - no partial execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebate Payment">
    If successful, you automatically receive SOL rebate in the same block
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much will I earn from rebates?">
    You earn 50% of the MEV your transaction creates. Earnings depend on the arbitrage potential of your trades - larger trades with higher price impact generally generate more MEV. The other 50% goes to Helius for providing the rebate infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When do rebate payments arrive?">
    Rebates are paid automatically in the same block as transaction execution. If your transaction creates profitable arbitrage and a searcher's backrun is included in the bundle, you'll receive SOL immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this completely safe?">
    Yes. Your transaction is never exposed publicly before execution and always executes first in the bundle, making frontrunning and sandwiching technically impossible. The searcher can only profit from arbitrage after your transaction completes. All bundle compositions and execution order are verifiable on-chain through any Solana explorer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use different rebate addresses for different transactions?">
    Absolutely. Each transaction can specify a different rebate address. This allows for flexible earning strategies or using different addresses for tracking purposes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if no backrun opportunity exists?">
    Your transaction executes normally as if rebates weren't enabled. There's no downside - worst case is identical to regular transaction processing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any fees or costs?">
    There are no additional fees beyond normal transaction costs. The revenue model is a 50/50 split of MEV generated - you earn 50% of the MEV your trade creates, and Helius keeps 50% for providing the rebate infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which transaction types generate the most rebates?">
    DEX swaps, large token transfers, NFT trades, and any transaction that creates arbitrage opportunities typically generate rebates. Larger trades with higher price impact tend to create more MEV.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track my total rebate earnings?">
    Yes. All rebates are on-chain SOL transfers to your specified address. You can track them via any Solana explorer.
