<Note>
**Staked Transactions Are the New Default**

Transactions sent through Helius now automatically use staked connections, providing the highest transaction landing rates for optimal speed and reliability. No code changes are required.

**What changed:**
- `sendTransaction` uses staked connections by default
- Staked connection pricing decreased from 50 to 10 credits
- The staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) has been deprecated - use the regular endpoint instead
- To use unstaked connections (1 credit per call), use `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com` - note that unstaked connections may not be reliable during network congestion
</Note>

## What are Staked Connections?

Staked Connections are a premium feature from Helius that provide a direct path to Solana validators through staked RPC nodes. These connections significantly improve transaction confirmation times and success rates by bypassing traditional transaction propagation mechanisms.

## How Staked Connections Work

When you send a transaction through a staked connection:

1. Your transaction is sent directly to the current leader validator
2. The transaction bypasses the traditional gossip network
3. This reduces confirmation latency and increases the likelihood of inclusion in the next block

<Note>
Helius' staked connections guarantee 100% transaction delivery with minimal confirmation times when used correctly.
</Note>

## Connection Options

### Default Staked Connections (Recommended)

All transactions sent through the standard Helius RPC endpoint now automatically use staked connections.

- **Endpoint:** `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Cost:** 10 credits per request
- **Benefits:**
  - Highest transaction landing rates
  - Optimized for speed and reliability
  - No code changes required

### Unstaked Connections (Legacy)

For applications that specifically need unstaked connections, you can use the dedicated unstaked endpoint.

- **Endpoint:** `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Cost:** 1 credit per request
- **Limitations:**
  - Not reliable during network congestion
  - Lower transaction success rates
  - Higher confirmation times

<Warning>
The dedicated staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) has been deprecated. Please migrate to using the regular endpoint (`mainnet.helius-rpc.com`) which now provides staked connections by default.
</Warning>

## Optimizing for Staked Connections

To get the most out of staked connections, we recommend these additional optimizations for latency-sensitive traders:

1. **Regional Optimization**
   - Send transactions from Eastern US or Western Europe
   - Consider Frankfurt or Pittsburgh for co-location with Helius transaction-sending servers
   - Avoid sending from regions far from the validator network (e.g., LATAM or South Africa)

2. **Cache Warming**
   - Send a `getHealth` call every second using the same endpoint & API key you use for sending transactions
   - Only one warming thread is required per region (additional warming threads provide no benefit)

## Using Staked Connections

Staked connections are now automatically used for all transactions sent through the standard Helius endpoint. No special configuration is required.

### Example: Standard Usage with Web3.js

```javascript
import { Connection, Keypair, SystemProgram } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize connection to Helius endpoint (now uses staked connections by default)
const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY');

// Create and sign transaction
// ...

// Send transaction (automatically uses staked connection)
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(serializedTransaction, {
  skipPreflight: true,
  maxRetries: 0
});
```

### Example: Using Unstaked Connections (if needed)

```javascript
import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize connection to unstaked endpoint (1 credit per request)
const connection = new Connection('https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY');

// Send transaction using unstaked connection
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(serializedTransaction, {
  skipPreflight: true,
  maxRetries: 0
});
```
