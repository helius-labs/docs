Sending transactions is a fundamental part of interacting with the Solana blockchain. Whether you're executing a trade on a DEX, minting an NFT, transferring assets, or calling a smart contract, a robust transaction-sending strategy is crucial for any application.

Helius provides powerful infrastructure and tools to ensure your transactions are submitted optimally, confirmed quickly, and delivered with the highest reliability.

## Transaction Sending Options

We offer multiple pathways for sending transactions, each designed for different needs and use cases.

## Staked vs. Unstaked Connections

Helius offers both staked and unstaked connections for sending transactions.

- **Staked Connections (Recommended)**: When you send transactions through our endpoints (available on paid plans), your transactions are routed directly to the current and upcoming block leaders. This provides a priority lane, bypassing the public transaction processing queue and offering near-guaranteed delivery. Using the Helius [Priority Fee API](/priority-fee-api) ensures you pay the optimal fee required by the leader.

- **Unstaked Connections**: On our free plan, transactions are sent through high-performance, but unstaked, RPC nodes. They are subject to the same network congestion and competition for leader processing as any other public transaction.

For any production application, using **staked connections is the single most effective way to ensure reliable transaction delivery.**
