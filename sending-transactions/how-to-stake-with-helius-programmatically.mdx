title: How to Stake With Helius Programmatically
description: >-
  Learn how to stake SOL on Solana using the Helius Node.js SDK with clean,
  programmatic flows
---

Welcome, Solana builder 👋 You are about to give your users a single-click staking flow while keeping full programmatic control in your codebase. The Helius Node.js SDK already wraps every low-level detail, so your job is mostly to decide **when** to call each helper and **who** signs the resulting transaction

This guide starts with general information about staking on Solana, then shows how to install the SDK, and finally walks through the full staking lifecycle with practical examples

***

## 1. Staking on Solana

* **Stake account**\
  A special account that locks up SOL. The SOL inside is **delegated** to a validator of your choice. You can have as many stake accounts as you like and each one points at exactly one validator
* **Rewards**\
  The validator earns rewards for producing blocks. Those rewards flow back into every stake account that selected that validator. When you use the Helius validator the commission rate is 0 %, so users keep everything
* **Life-cycle**\
  1 ) _Create and delegate_\
  2 ) _Cool down_ (optional deactivation)\
  3 ) _Withdraw_ or _re-delegate_\
  \
  The helper methods map to these exact lifecycle phases

***

## 2. One-time Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash
# Install only what is required
npm i helius-sdk @solana/web3.js bs58
```

```ts
// helius.ts
import { Helius } from 'helius-sdk';

// Replace with the API key you see in the Helius dashboard
export const helius = new Helius('YOUR_API_KEY');

/*
   The SDK creates its own Connection that targets mainnet-beta
*/
```
</CodeGroup>

From this point on, every snippet will assume you imported this `helius` instance and that you hold a funded `Keypair` called `payer`.

## 3. Method Reference with Example Calls

| Helper | Purpose | Return value | Example call |
| :------ | :------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| **createStakeTransaction** | Builds a serialized, unsigned transaction that creates a new stake account, and delegates it to the Helius validator | `{ serializedTx, stakeAccountPubkey }` | `await helius.rpc.createStakeTransaction(owner, 1.5)` |
| **getStakeInstructions** | The same as **createStakeTransaction**, except it _only_ returns the `TransactionInstruction[]`. This is useful inside browser wallets that construct their own transaction object, or pairing with the SDK's [smart transactions](/sending-transactions/smart-transactions) | `{ instructions, stakeAccount }` | `await helius.rpc.getStakeInstructions(owner, 1.5)` |
| **createUnstakeTransaction** | Builds a serialized, unsigned transaction that sends a `Deactivate` instruction to an existing stake account | `serializedTx` | `await helius.rpc.createUnstakeTransaction(owner, stakeAcc)` |
| **getUnstakeInstruction** | Single `Deactivate` instruction with no wrapper transaction | `TransactionInstruction` | `helius.rpc.getUnstakeInstruction(owner, stakeAcc)` |
| **getWithdrawableAmount** | Returns the number of lamports that can be withdrawn right now from a given stake account. Pass `true` to include the rent-exempt minimum into the withdrawable amount | `number` | `await helius.rpc.getWithdrawableAmount(stakeAcc, true)` |
| **createWithdrawTransaction** | Builds a serialized, unsigned transaction that moves lamports out of a stake account into any destination address. Works only after the cooldown period has ended | `serializedTx` | `await helius.rpc.createWithdrawTransaction(owner, stakeAcc, dest, amount)` |
| **getWithdrawInstruction** | Stand-alone withdraw instruction | `TransactionInstruction` | `helius.rpc.getWithdrawInstruction(owner, stakeAcc, dest, amount)` |
| **getHeliusStakeAccounts** | Returns all stake accounts that are currently delegated to the Helius validator for a given wallet | `ParsedAccountData[]` | `await helius.rpc.getHeliusStakeAccounts(wallet)` |

## 4. Quickstart: Stake in Three Simple Steps

```ts
import { Transaction } from '@solana/web3.js';
import bs58 from 'bs58';

/* 1. Build the unsigned transaction */
const { serializedTx, stakeAccountPubkey } =
  await helius.rpc.createStakeTransaction(payer.publicKey, 1.5); // amount in SOL, rent added automatically

/* 2. Sign with the fee payer */
const tx = Transaction.from(bs58.decode(serializedTx));
tx.partialSign(payer);          // the new stake account is already signed by the SDK

/* 3. Broadcast */
const sig = await helius.connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
console.log(`Staked 1.5 SOL. Track it at https://orb.helius.dev/tx/${sig}`);
```

## 5. Full Lifecycle Cookbook

### 5.1 Fetch every stake account that delegates to Helius for a given wallet

```ts
import { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from '@solana/web3.js';

const accounts = await helius.rpc.getHeliusStakeAccounts(payer.publicKey.toBase58());

accounts.forEach(acc => {
  const d = (acc.account.data as any).parsed.info.stake.delegation;
  console.log(
    `${acc.pubkey.toBase58()} holds ${d.stake / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} SOL (activated in epoch ${d.activationEpoch})`
  );
});
```

### 5.2 Deactivate (begin cooldown)

```ts
const blob = await helius.rpc.createUnstakeTransaction(payer.publicKey, stakeAccountPubkey);

const tx = Transaction.from(bs58.decode(blob));
tx.partialSign(payer);

await helius.connection.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
console.log('Deactivation requested. The stake becomes withdrawable at the end of the current epoch.');
```

### 5.3 Check how many lamports can be withdrawn

```ts
const lamportsNow   = await helius.rpc.getWithdrawableAmount(stakeAccountPubkey);
const lamportsTotal = await helius.rpc.getWithdrawableAmount(stakeAccountPubkey, true);

console.log(`Available right now: ${lamportsNow}. Full balance: ${lamportsTotal}.`);
```

### 5.4 Withdraw part, or all, of the balance

```ts
const instruction = helius.rpc.getWithdrawInstruction(
  payer.publicKey,
  stakeAccountPubkey,
  destinationPubkey,
  lamportsTotal        // withdraw everything; use a smaller number for partial
);

const sig = await helius.rpc.sendSmartTransaction([instruction], [payer]);
console.log(`Withdrawal sent. Track it at https://orb.helius.dev/tx/${sig}`);
```

## 6. Power User Patterns

<Accordion title="Browser-only Staking">
Call `getStakeInstructions`, feed the returned instructions into the wallet adapter, and let the wallet build and sign the transaction
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Batching">
Loop over wallets, call `createStakeTransaction` for each, and send the blobs in parallel. Respect your rate limit
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart Transactions">
Use `getStakeInstructions`, `getUnstakeInstruction`, and `getWithdrawInstruction` with our [smart transactions](/sending-transactions/smart-transactions) to ensure your staking transactions are well-optimized and land as fast as possible
</Accordion>

## 7. Common Pitfalls

- **Epoch timing**\
A Solana epoch lasts roughly two days. If you deactivate halfway through epoch 600, the stake stays locked until epoch 601 begins

- **Rent exempt minimum**\
The stake account will be closed if you withdraw the _full_ balance, including rent. If you withdraw less than the rent-exempt threshold, the account will remain open

- **Hardware wallets**\
Users see two prompts: one signature for the new stake account (already signed within the blob) and one for the fee payer. Make sure your UX explains this

***

## 8. One-page Cheat Sheet

```ts
// Stake SOL to Helius validator
await helius.rpc.createStakeTransaction(owner, amountInSol);

// Deactivate stake account
await helius.rpc.createUnstakeTransaction(owner, stakeAccount);

// Withdraw SOL (after cooldown)
helius.rpc.getWithdrawInstruction(owner, stakeAccount, destination, lamports);
```
