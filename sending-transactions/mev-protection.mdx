## Why MEV Protection Matters

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the additional profit a validator (or a block builder) can earn by re-ordering, inserting, or censoring transactions in a block.  
For end-users this often shows up as:

- **Front-running** – a validator sees your pending transaction and inserts its own before yours to capture price movement.
- **Back-running / Sandwiching** – your trade is wrapped by two adversarial trades causing you to receive a worse execution price.

By default, a Solana transaction is gossiped to _all_ validators. While this increases liveness, it also exposes your intent to potentially malicious actors. **Helius allows you to explicitly control which validators receive your transaction** via the `validatorAcls` parameter.

## Code Example

```ts
import { Helius, SFDP_REJECTS_URL } from "helius-sdk";
import bs58 from "bs58";

const helius = new Helius("YOUR_API_KEY");

try {
  const response = await helius.rpc.sendTransaction(transaction, {
    validatorAcls: [SFDP_REJECTS_URL],
    skipPreflight: true,
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
