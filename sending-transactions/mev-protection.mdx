## Why MEV Protection Matters

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the additional profit a validator (or a block builder) can earn by re-ordering, inserting, or censoring transactions in a block.  
For end-users this often shows up as:

- **Front-running** – a validator sees your pending transaction and inserts its own before yours to capture price movement.
- **Back-running / Sandwiching** – your trade is wrapped by two adversarial trades causing you to receive a worse execution price.

By default, a Solana transaction is gossiped to _all_ validators. While this increases liveness, it also exposes your intent to potentially malicious actors. **Helius allows you to explicitly control which validators receive your transaction** via the `validatorAcls` parameter.

## Code Example

The following snippet shows how to use the Helius SDK to submit a transaction with MEV protection enabled.

```ts
import { Helius, SFDP_REJECTS_URL } from "helius-sdk";

const helius = new Helius("YOUR_API_KEY");

try {
  const response = await helius.rpc.sendTransaction(transaction, {
    validatorAcls: [SFDP_REJECTS_URL],
    skipPreflight: true,
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

<Note>
 `SFDP_REJECTS_URL` is a constant exported by the SDK that resolves to
 [`https://helius-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sfdp_rejects.json`](https://helius-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sfdp_rejects.json)—a curated deny list of validators known to engage in sandwich attacks.

## ACL File Format

Each URL you supply in `validatorAcls` must return a JSON document with the following shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "validator_acl": {
    "type": "allow",        // or "deny"
    "identities": [
      "<validator-pubkey>",   // base-58 Solana validator identity
      "...additional keys..."
    ]
  }
}
```

Field semantics:

- `version` – Schema version (currently `1`). Reserved for future upgrades.
- `validator_acl.type` – Either `"allow"` or `"deny"`.
  • **allow** → Only the listed `identities` are permitted to receive the transaction.
  • **deny**  → All validators *except* the listed `identities` are permitted.
- `validator_acl.identities` – Array of base-58 validator identity pubkeys to apply the rule to.

Example *deny-list* ACL:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "validator_acl": {
    "type": "deny",
    "identities": [
      "<validator-pubkey>",   // base-58 Solana validator identity
      "...additional keys..."
    ]
  }
}
```
