description: 'Troubleshoot HTTP error codes when using Helius RPC endpoints'
---

When working with Helius RPC endpoints, you might encounter HTTP error codes. This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve the most common issues.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 401 error?">
  
  ## What this means
  <Warning>**401 Unauthorized** - Your request lacks valid authentication credentials.</Warning>
  
  ## Common causes
  - Invalid or missing API key
  - API key included in the wrong location
  - Access Control Rules blocking your request
  - Expired or revoked API key
  
  ## Solutions
  
  1. **Verify your API key format**
     ```
     https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
  
  2. **Check API key placement**
     - Ensure the API key is in the query parameters
     - Verify there are no extra spaces or characters
  
  3. **Review Access Control Rules**
     - Check your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.helius.dev/) for IP restrictions
     - Ensure your domain is allowlisted if using browser requests
  
  <Info>For detailed authentication setup, see our [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) guide.</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 429 error?">
  
  ## What this means
  <Warning>**429 Too Many Requests** - You've exceeded your plan's rate limits.</Warning>
  
  ## Common causes
  - Making requests faster than your plan allows
  - Burst traffic exceeding instantaneous limits
  - Multiple applications sharing the same API key
  - Inefficient code making redundant requests
  
  ## Solutions
  
  1. **Monitor your usage**
     - Check the `Rate Limited Requests` graph in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/usage)
     - Review which endpoints are hitting limits
  
  2. **Optimize your requests**
     - Cache responses when possible
     - Batch multiple operations into single calls
     - Remove unnecessary polling or duplicate requests
  
  3. **Implement rate limiting**
     - Add delays between requests in your application
     - Use exponential backoff for retries
  
  4. **Consider upgrading**
     - Review [Plans & Rate Limits](/billing/plans-and-rate-limits) for higher tiers
  
  <Tip>Rate limits reset every minute, so temporary throttling usually resolves quickly.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 500 error?">
  
  ## What this means
  <Warning>**500 Internal Server Error** - A server-side error occurred while processing your request.</Warning>
  
  ## Common causes
  - Malformed request payload
  - Server experiencing temporary issues
  - Invalid parameters causing server errors
  - Network connectivity problems
  
  ## Solutions
  
  1. **Validate your request**
     - Ensure JSON payload is properly formatted
     - Verify all required parameters are included
     - Check parameter types match the API specification
  
  2. **Check service status**
     - Visit the [Helius Status Page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for ongoing issues
     - Look for any reported outages or degraded performance
  
  3. **Implement retry logic**
     - Wait a few seconds before retrying
     - Use exponential backoff for multiple attempts
  
  4. **Get support**
     - If errors persist, contact support with your request details
     - Include the exact request payload and timestamp
  
  <Note>Server errors are typically temporary and usually resolve automatically.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 503 error?">
  
  ## What this means
  <Warning>**503 Service Unavailable** - The server is temporarily overloaded or under maintenance.</Warning>
  
  ## Common causes
  - High traffic causing temporary overload
  - Scheduled maintenance windows
  - Server capacity limits reached
  - Network infrastructure issues
  
  ## Solutions
  
  1. **Wait and retry**
     - Wait 30-60 seconds before trying again
     - This error usually resolves as load balances
  
  2. **Implement smart retries**
     - Use exponential backoff (start with 1s, then 2s, 4s, etc.)
     - Set a maximum retry limit (3-5 attempts)
     - Add jitter to avoid thundering herd effects
  
  3. **Check for maintenance**
     - Review the [Helius Status Page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for scheduled maintenance
     - Plan around announced maintenance windows
  
  4. **Distribute load**
     - If possible, spread requests over time
     - Avoid burst patterns that can trigger overload protection
  
  <Tip>503 errors are designed to be temporary - the service automatically recovers as server load decreases.</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 504 error?">
  
  ## What this means
  <Warning>**504 Gateway Timeout** - The server didn't receive a response from upstream services within the timeout period.</Warning>
  
  ## Common causes
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Complex operations exceeding timeout limits
  - Slow blockchain responses during high network congestion
  - Large data requests taking too long to process
  
  ## Solutions
  
  1. **Check your connection**
     - Verify your internet connection is stable
     - Test with a simple request to rule out local issues
  
  2. **Optimize large requests**
     - Break large batch requests into smaller chunks
     - Use pagination for data-heavy queries
     - Consider using WebSocket connections for real-time data
  
  3. **Implement timeouts**
     - Set appropriate timeout values in your client code (30-60 seconds)
     - Handle timeout errors gracefully with retries
  
  4. **Monitor service status**
     - Check the [Helius Status Page](https://helius.statuspage.io/) for network issues
     - Look for reports of high blockchain congestion
  
  <Note>Gateway timeouts often indicate network congestion or complex operations. Consider breaking large requests into smaller parts.</Note>
