## Endpoints

Enhanced Websockets are available on mainnet and devnet with the following URLs:

- **Mainnet** `wss://laserstream-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`
- **Devnet** `wss://laserstream-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Note>
WebSockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer. Implementing health checks and sending pings every minute is heavily recommended to keep the WebSocket connection alive.
