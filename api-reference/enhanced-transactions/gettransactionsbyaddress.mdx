<Warning>
**Handling Incomplete Transaction Sets**

Occasionally, history endpoint may return an incomplete set of transactions due to internal timeouts during data retrieval.

To mitigate this issue:
1. First, call `getSignaturesForAddress` to retrieve a batch of transaction signatures
2. Next, use the `/v0/transactions` endpoint with the received signatures
3. If any transactions are missing from the response, you can retry fetching these specific transactions
</Warning>
