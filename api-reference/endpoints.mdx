## Solana RPC endpoints

Standard, high-performance RPC endpoints providing full Solana API compatibility with enhanced reliability and throughput. These endpoints support all Solana JSON-RPC methods and now **use staked connections by default** for optimal transaction landing rates:

- **Mainnet**: `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Devnet**: `https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

<Note>
**Staked Transactions Are the New Default**

Transactions sent through Helius will automatically use staked connections, providing you with the highest transaction landing rates and ensuring your transactions are optimized for speed and reliability. No code changes required.
</Note>

## Secure RPC endpoints

These URLs are specifically masked and IP rate-limited at 5 TPS, making them safe to use directly from frontend applications without exposing your API credits:

- **Mainnet**: `https://YOUR_-fast-mainnet.helius-rpc.com`
- **Devnet**: `https://YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-fast-devnet.helius-rpc.com`

## Staked Connection endpoints (Deprecated)

<Warning>
**Deprecated**: The staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) has been deprecated. Use the regular endpoint instead (`mainnet.helius-rpc.com`) which now uses staked connections by default.
</Warning>

Staked connections are now the default for all transactions sent through Helius standard endpoints. This change provides:

- **Cost**: 10 credits per `sendTransaction` request (reduced from 50 credits)
- **Automatic optimization**: All transactions are sent over optimized network infrastructure (Asia, Europe, and North America)
- **Higher landing rates**: Guaranteed access to staked connections during market congestion
- **No code changes required**: Existing applications automatically benefit from staked connections

### Unstaked Connections

If you need to use unstaked connections (1 credit per call), you can use:

- **Mainnet**: `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

<Warning>
Unstaked connections will not be reliable during periods of network congestion. We recommend using the default staked connections for production applications.
</Warning>

## Solana Websocket Endpoints

Standard WebSocket endpoints that provide real-time data streaming according to the Solana WebSocket protocol. These endpoints support all standard Solana WebSocket subscription methods including account, program, signature, slot, and log subscriptions:

- **Mainnet**: `wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Devnet**: `wss://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

### Key Features

- **Supported subscriptions**: `accountSubscribe`, `programSubscribe`, `signatureSubscribe`, `slotSubscribe`, `logsSubscribe`, and more
- **Protocol compatibility**: Fully compatible with Solana's standard WebSocket API
- **Best for**: Applications that need to monitor account changes, track transaction confirmations, or receive real-time updates on blockchain activity
- **Connection management**: Implement periodic pings every 30-60 seconds to maintain active connections

## Geyser Enhanced Websocket Endpoints

Enhanced WebSockets offer faster response times than traditional RPC WebSockets and provide real-time transaction and account updates directly to your applications:

- **Mainnet**: `wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Devnet**: `wss://atlas-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

### Key Features

- **Available for**: Business and professional plans only (not the same as Yellowstone Geyser, which requires a Dedicated Node)
- **Subscription methods**: Supports `transactionSubscribe` and `accountSubscribe`
- **Connection management**: Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; implement health checks and send pings every minute to keep connections alive
- **Current status**: In beta, occasionally may experience delayed data
