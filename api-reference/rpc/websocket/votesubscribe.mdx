description: "Subscribe to receive notification anytime a new vote is observed in gossip. These votes are pre-consensus therefore there is no guarantee these votes will enter the ledger."
"og:description": "Get a free RPC and explore the voteSubscribe RPC Method. Includes request parameters, response examples, code snippets, and in-browser testing for both Solana Mainnet and Devnet."

<Note>
This subscription is unstable and only available if the validator was started with the `--rpc-pubsub-enable-vote-subscription` flag. The format of this subscription may change in the future.
</Note>

## Endpoints

Websockets are available on mainnet and devnet with the following URLs:

- **Mainnet** `wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`
- **Devnet** `wss://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Note>Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; implementing health checks and sending pings every minute is heavily recommended to keep the websocket connection alive.</Note>
