## Price Data Caching

<Warning>
Price data returned by getAsset is cached and may not be fresh. The price information has a 60-second cache, meaning the data can be up to 60 seconds old.
</Warning>

Price data is only available for Jupiter verified tokens and can be found in the `token_info.price_info` section of the response. For applications requiring real-time pricing, consider implementing additional validation or using Jupiter's direct API for the most current data.
