## Price Data Caching

<Warning>
Price data returned by getAsset is cached and may not be fresh. The price information has a 60-second cache, meaning the data can be up to 60 seconds old.
</Warning>

Price data is available for the top 10k tokens by 24h volume and can be found in the `token_info.price_info` section of the response. For applications requiring real-time pricing, consider implementing additional validation.
