## Determining Appropriate Priority Fees

1. **Use the Priority Fee API**: Always use `getPriorityFeeEstimate` with the `recommended: true` option to get a reasonable baseline fee based on current network conditions.

2. **Match transaction urgency to priority level**:
   - `Low` - Non-urgent transactions, can wait for confirmation
   - `Medium` - Standard priority, reasonable confirmation time
   - `High` - Time-sensitive transactions
   - `VeryHigh` - Critical transactions during high congestion

3. **Adjust during network congestion**: During high network activity, consider using higher priority levels to ensure timely processing.

4. **Monitor performance**: Track your transaction performance and adjust your priority fee strategy based on real-world results.

## Transaction Configuration

1. **Add compute budget instructions first**: Always place compute budget instructions at the beginning of your transaction for proper processing.

2. **Don't overestimate compute unit needs**: Request only the compute units your transaction actually requires to avoid wasting SOL.

3. **Set maxRetries to 0 with staked connections**: This ensures proper handling by the Helius infrastructure.

4. **Update before sending**: Always refresh the blockhash before signing and sending the final transaction.

## Account-Based Estimates

1. **Include all relevant accounts**: For accurate estimates, include all writable accounts that will be part of your transaction.

2. **Focus on writable accounts**: The v2 algorithm primarily considers writable accounts, so prioritize including those in your account list.

3. **Be aware of limitations**: Account-based estimates don't consider instruction-specific factors that might affect fees.

4. **Handle sparse history**: Use `evaluateEmptySlotAsZero: true` for accounts with infrequent activity.

## Serialized Transaction Estimates

1. **Always serialize the actual transaction**: For accurate local fee market estimates, serialize the same transaction you'll send, not a simplified version.

2. **Include all actual instructions**: The Priority Fee API works best when the serialized transaction includes all instructions (except the priority fee instruction itself).

3. **Compare with account-based estimates**: When possible, compare these estimates with account-based estimates to understand the differences.

4. **Handle errors gracefully**: The API may return errors if your transaction is malformed or contains invalid instructions.
