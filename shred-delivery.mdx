## What is Shred Delivery?

Shred Delivery is Helius's **premier low-latency data streaming service**, designed to provide traders with the earliest possible access to Solana's raw transaction data. By delivering unprocessed shreds directly from the network, Shred Delivery offers a significant competitive edge for high-frequency trading (HFT), arbitrage strategies, and other latency-sensitive applications.

## What Are Shreds?

In Solana, transactions are broken down into smaller data packets called **"shreds"** to facilitate efficient and rapid propagation across the network. Each shred is a fragment of transaction data, optimized to fit within standard network packets, ensuring swift distribution and reconstruction into complete blocks by validators.



This architecture is pivotal for maintaining Solana's high throughput and low latency, and Shred Delivery taps directly into this raw data stream before any processing occurs.

    **"First Look" at Transactions**
    - Raw, unprocessed shred data
    - Earliest possible on-chain signal
    - Requires custom deshredding logic
    - Manual provisioning only
    - High-frequency traders & arbitrage strategies
  </Card>
  <Card title="LaserStream" icon="rocket" color="#00D4AA">
    **Processed & Reliable Data**
    - Commitment-level guarantees (processed, confirmed, finalized)
    - Historical replay capabilities
    - Developer-friendly SDKs
    - Automatic reconnection
    - Production applications & analytics

## The Helius Validator Advantage

Helius operates **the highest staked validator on Solana**, giving us unmatched access to raw shreds through Solana's Turbine protocol. In Turbine, validators with higher stake weights receive priority in the data propagation tree, meaning block leaders send shreds to high-stake validators like Helius first.

This stake-weighted propagation ensures we receive shreds at the earliest possible moment in the network's data flow. While other providers must wait for secondary propagation or rely on unstaked infrastructure, our validator position grants direct, prioritized access to the raw transaction data as it flows through the network.



## Technical Requirements

To effectively utilize Shred Delivery, your system should have:
