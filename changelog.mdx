  ## Transaction Sender Beta Launch

  **June 30, 2024**

  Our new transaction sender is now open to the public in beta with many more improvements to come.

  **Key Features:**
  - **Parallel Sending**: Simultaneous transmission to both Jito and Helius SWQOS, which has the highest stake on the network
  - **7 Regional Endpoints**: Network optimized endpoints to reduce latency
  - **Beta Access**: Available now through your dashboard

  **To Access:**
  Navigate to Dashboard → Sender (on the left sidebar)

  <Note>
  We'd love feedback to improve the sender as we're making active improvements every day.

  ## Jito Bundle Simulation Support

  **June 25, 2024**

  You can now use Helius RPCs for simulating Jito bundles, enabling you to test and validate your bundle transactions before submission.

  **What's New:**
  - **Bundle Simulation**: Test your Jito bundles using Helius infrastructure
  - **Pre-submission Validation**: Catch potential issues before sending bundles to the network
  - **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Helius RPC endpoints

  ## LaserStream Public Release

  **June 18, 2024**

  Today, Solana gets a huge upgrade. We are finally releasing LaserStream — the fastest, most reliable way of streaming Solana blocks, transactions, and account data via gRPC.

  **LaserStream Features:**
  - **Optimized Shredstream**: Receive data before anyone else
  - **Historical Replay & Persistence**: If you disconnect, start from the slot where you disconnected and never miss data
  - **Extreme Redundancy**: Powered by many redundant node clusters so you never worry about downtime or your stream falling behind
  - **Regional Endpoints**: Available in all major regions (Tokyo, Frankfurt, Newark, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, Amsterdam, Singapore) — no need to wait for node availability or buy an entire node
  - **Massive Scale**: Listen up to 250,000 addresses per connection; up to 100 simultaneous connections
  - **Ready-to-Go Client SDKs**: Optional SDKs available for easy integration
  - **gRPC Compatible**: Works with existing gRPC code

  **Getting Started:**
  - Have a professional Helius plan
  - Read the documentation
  - Open your dashboard and click LaserStream

  <Note>
  LaserStream-powered WebSocket streaming coming soon!

<Update label="May 2024">
  ## Staked Transactions Are the New Default

  **What's Changed:**
  - **Staked Connections Default**: Transactions sent through Helius now automatically use staked connections by default, providing you with the highest transaction landing rates and optimizing for speed and reliability. No code changes required.
  - **Pricing Update**: Staked connection pricing decreased from 50 to 10 credits per transaction, making it more cost-effective to use our premium transaction infrastructure.

  **Endpoint Changes:**
  - **Staked Endpoint**: The dedicated staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) is being phased out in favor of the regular endpoint which now uses staked connections by default. You can continue using the staked endpoint for now, but we recommend switching to the regular endpoint (`mainnet.helius-rpc.com`) for the best experience.

  **Alternative Options:**
  - **Unstaked Connections**: To continue using unstaked connections (1 credit per call), use `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com`. Please note that unstaked connections may not be reliable during periods of network congestion.

  ## Massive RPC Performance Improvements

  **Big news:** We've reduced latency on all Solana account-based RPC calls by up to 95%! 

  **p95 improvements:**
  - [`getProgramAccounts`](/rpc/guides/getprogramaccounts) — 95% faster
  - [`getAccountInfo`](/rpc/guides/getaccountinfo), [`getMultipleAccounts`](/rpc/guides/getmultipleaccounts), [`getBalance`](/rpc/guides/getbalance), [`getSlot`](/rpc/guides/getslot) — 60% faster  
  - [`getTokenAccountsByOwner`](/rpc/guides/gettokenaccountsbyowner) — 50% faster

  **Steps to use it:** Nothing! If you use a shared and paid Helius subscription (i.e., not dedicated nodes), you get automatic access.

  **What this means for you:**
  - **Faster dApp loading times**: Account data fetches nearly instantly
  - **Better user experience**: Reduced waiting times for balance checks and token account queries
  - **More efficient development**: Faster iteration cycles when building and testing
  - **Improved scalability**: Handle more concurrent requests with the same infrastructure
