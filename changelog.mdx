## [2024-05-29] - Staked Transactions Are the New Default

### Changed
- **Staked Connections Default**: Transactions sent through Helius now automatically use staked connections by default, providing you with the highest transaction landing rates and optimizing for speed and reliability. No code changes required.

- **Pricing Update**: Staked connection pricing decreased from 50 to 10 credits per transaction, making it more cost-effective to use our premium transaction infrastructure.

### Deprecated  
- **Staked Endpoint**: The dedicated staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) is being phased out in favor of the regular endpoint which now uses staked connections by default. You can continue using the staked endpoint for now, but we recommend switching to the regular endpoint (`mainnet.helius-rpc.com`) for the best experience.

### Alternative Options
- **Unstaked Connections**: To continue using unstaked connections (1 credit per call), use `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com`. Please note that unstaked connections may not be reliable during periods of network congestion.

<Info>
This change was [previously announced on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6GXdee3gBj). The `sendTransaction` method now uses staked connections automatically, ensuring optimal transaction performance without any code modifications.
