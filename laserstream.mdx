## What is LaserStream?

LaserStream is a next-generation streaming service **purpose-built for developers who need reliable, low-latency Solana data**. It delivers on-chain events (transactions, slots, blocks, accounts, and more) directly to your application with industry-leading reliability, performance, and flexibility. Similar to our gRPC offerings, LaserStream nodes tap directly into Solana leaders to receive shreds as they're produced, delivering ultra-low latency data to your application.

Unlike standard Solana RPC nodes, LaserStream is specifically designed for streaming use cases, offering features not available in conventional node setups:

## LaserStream vs. Shred Delivery: Quick Comparison

<Tip>
**TL;DR**: LaserStream delivers **processed data** with commitment-level guarantees (processed, confirmed, finalized), making it turnkey and production-ready. For the **earliest possible raw data** before any processing occurs, see [Shred Delivery](/shred-delivery)—but you must implement custom deshredding logic.
</Tip>

| Feature | LaserStream | Shred Delivery |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Data Type** | Processed data with commitment guarantees | Raw, unprocessed shreds |
| **Latency** | Ultra-low latency processed data | **Earliest possible** - before any processing |
| **Processing** | Turnkey - data is processed and ready to use | **You must process raw data** - requires custom deshredding logic |
| **Best For** | Production applications, analytics, backend services | High-frequency trading, arbitrage (when milliseconds matter) |
| **Setup** | Developer-friendly SDKs, drop-in replacement | White glove provisioning (beta access required) |

**Key Distinction**: LaserStream provides processed, structured data with reliability features like historical replay and automatic reconnection—ideal for production applications. Shred Delivery provides the **absolute earliest signal** from Solana's network, but requires you to handle raw data processing.

## Easy Migration

<Note>
**Drop-in Replacement**: LaserStream gRPC is designed as a seamless drop-in replacement for your existing gRPC setup. Simply change your endpoint and API token, and your application will work with LaserStream immediately.
</Note>

### Using Existing gRPC Code

If you already use Yellowstone gRPC, migrating to LaserStream is as simple as:

```typescript
// Before: Using standard Yellowstone gRPC
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "your-current-endpoint.com",
  { token: "your-current-token" }
);

// After: Using LaserStream (just change endpoint and token)
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com", // Choose your closest region
  { token: "your-helius-api-key" }
);
```

### Enhanced Experience with the LaserStream SDK

While LaserStream works with your existing code, we highly recommend using our [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) for enhanced capabilities:

```typescript
// Using the dedicated LaserStream SDK
import { subscribe, CommitmentLevel, LaserstreamConfig } from 'helius-laserstream';

const config = {
  apiKey: "your-helius-api-key",
  endpoint: "https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com" // Choose your closest region
};

// The SDK automatically handles:
// - Connection management
// - Reconnection with backoff
// - Historical replay after disconnects
// - Subscription management
await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, handleData, handleError);
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Reconnection & Catch-up

The [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) automatically handles dropped connections, network issues, and data gaps. When a reconnection occurs, the SDK automatically:

- Reconnects with minimal delay
- Re-streams any data that was missed during the downtime
- Continues streaming without intervention


### Advanced Filtering

LaserStream supports sophisticated filtering options:

- **Account Filtering**: Include, exclude, or require specific accounts
- **Transaction Types**: Filter by transaction status, vote transactions, etc.
- **Commitment Levels**: Choose from processed, confirmed, or finalized
- **Data Content**: Request specific data fields or full data

### Extreme Scalability

- **Load Balancing**: Connections distributed across multiple nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Backend resources scale to match demand
- **Efficient Routing**: Requests automatically routed to the most responsive node

## Endpoints & Regions

LaserStream is available in multiple regions worldwide for optimal performance. Choose the endpoint closest to your application's location:

### Mainnet Endpoints

| Region | Location | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **ewr** | Newark, NJ (near New York) | `https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com` |

| Network | Location | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Devnet** | Newark, NJ (near New York) | `https://laserstream-devnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com` |

<Note>
**Choosing Your Network & Region**: 
- For **production applications**, use a mainnet endpoint closest to your server location. For example, if your server is in Frankfurt, use `https://laserstream-mainnet-fra.helius-rpc.com`.
- For **development and testing**, use the devnet endpoint: `https://laserstream-devnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com`.
</Note>
