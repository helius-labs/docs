## Introduction

Laserstream is a multi-protocol streaming service **designed for developers building real-time applications on Solana**. It delivers crucial on-chain data (transactions, slots, blocks, accounts, etc.) directly to your application without requiring you to manage a dedicated node.

Built to serve as a near drop-in replacement for existing Solana streaming solutions with minimal configuration changes, Laserstream offers significant advantages:

*   **Historical Replay**: The [LaserStream client](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream) automatically backfills data if you disconnect, ensuring you never miss critical updates.
*   **Stay Synced**: By aggregating data from multiple nodes, Laserstream keeps pace with Solana's high throughput, preventing your application from lagging behind.
*   **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with dedicated client libraries and straightforward configuration or by using existing libraries such as Yellowstone gRPC.
*   **Extreme Availability**: Each Laserstream worker is backed by multiple RPC nodes deployed across multiple clusters, providing robust failover capabilities.

## Supported Protocols

You can choose whichever protocol (or combination) best suits your application's needs:

### **gRPC**

High-performance streaming interface (via [Helius Laserstream client](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream) or the Yellowstone library).

#### **WebSocket**

Offering faster response times than standard Solana WebSockets, with specialized subscription methods (`transactionSubscribe`, `accountSubscribe`).

<Info>
We suggest using **gRPC** for backend applications due to its high performance, low latency, and robust streaming capabilities. However, since gRPC is a binary protocol and not readily supported in most browsers, **WebSockets**—either Enhanced or standard—are recommended for frontend use.

***

Laserstream gives you the freedom to choose the **streaming protocol**—gRPC, Enhanced WebSockets, or standard Solana WebSockets—that best fits your application. Combined with our multi-node infrastructure, historical replay, and failover capabilities, you can confidently build real-time Solana applications without worrying about data gaps or lag.
