## What is LaserStream?

LaserStream is a next-generation streaming service **purpose-built for developers who need reliable, real-time Solana data**. It delivers on-chain events (transactions, slots, blocks, accounts, and more) directly to your application with industry-leading reliability, performance, and flexibility. Similar to our gRPC offerings, LaserStream nodes tap directly into Solana leaders to receive shreds as they're produced, delivering ultra-low latency data to your application.

Unlike standard Solana RPC nodes, LaserStream is specifically designed for streaming use cases, offering features not available in conventional node setups:

    Automatically backfill missed data by specifying a starting slot, ensuring data continuity even after disconnections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Node Reliability" icon="server">
    Stream from multiple aggregated nodes simultaneously, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring maximum uptime.

    Purpose-built for streaming with optimized connection handling, reducing latency and improving throughput compared to standard connections.

## Easy Migration

<Note>
**Drop-in Replacement**: LaserStream is designed as a seamless drop-in replacement for your existing gRPC setup. Simply change your endpoint and API token, and your application will work with LaserStream immediately.
</Note>

### Using Existing gRPC Code

If you already use Yellowstone gRPC, migrating to LaserStream is as simple as:

```typescript
// Before: Using standard Yellowstone gRPC
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "your-current-endpoint.com",
  { token: "your-current-token" }
);

// After: Using LaserStream (just change endpoint and token)
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "laserstream-endpoint.helius.xyz",
  { token: "your-helius-api-key" }
);
```

### Enhanced Experience with the LaserStream SDK

While LaserStream works with your existing code, we highly recommend using our [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) for enhanced capabilities:

```typescript
// Using the dedicated LaserStream SDK
import { subscribe, CommitmentLevel, LaserstreamConfig } from 'helius-laserstream';

const config = {
  apiKey: "your-helius-api-key",
  endpoint: "laserstream-endpoint.helius.xyz"
};

// The SDK automatically handles:
// - Connection management
// - Reconnection with backoff
// - Historical replay after disconnects
// - Subscription management
await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, handleData, handleError);
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Reconnection & Catch-up

The [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) automatically handles dropped connections, network issues, and data gaps. When a reconnection occurs, the SDK automatically:

- Reestablishes the connection with minimal delay
- Requests any data that was missed during the disconnection period
- Continues streaming without intervention
- Implements exponential backoff for unstable connections

### Multi-Protocol Support

LaserStream is designed with multi-protocol support in mind:

| Protocol | Status | Best For | Features | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **gRPC** | ✅ Available | Backend services, high-throughput applications | Highest performance, binary protocol, bi-directional streaming | Via LaserStream SDK or Yellowstone |
| **WebSocket** | 🔜 Coming soon | Frontend applications, browser clients | JSON-based, widely supported in browsers, familiar for web developers | Standard WebSocket clients (e.g., `ws` library) |

<Note>
**WebSocket support is coming soon!** Currently, LaserStream is available only via gRPC. WebSocket integration is under active development and will be available in a future update.
</Note>

### Advanced Filtering

LaserStream supports sophisticated filtering options:

- **Account Filtering**: Include, exclude, or require specific accounts
- **Transaction Types**: Filter by transaction status, vote transactions, etc.
- **Commitment Levels**: Choose from processed, confirmed, or finalized
- **Data Content**: Request specific data fields or full data

### Extreme Scalability

- **Load Balancing**: Connections distributed across multiple nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Backend resources scale to match demand
- **Efficient Routing**: Requests automatically routed to the most responsive node

| **Historical replay** | ✅ Up to 3000 slots (approx. 20 minutes) | ❌ Not available | ❌ Limited |
| **Auto-reconnect** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Manual implementation | ❌ Manual implementation |
| **Multi-node failover** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual implementation | ❌ Manual implementation |
| **WebSocket support** | 🔜 Coming soon | ✅ Standard | ❌ Not available |
| **gRPC support** | ✅ Enhanced | ❌ Not available | ✅ Standard |
| **Setup complexity** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Infrastructure management** | None (fully managed) | High | Medium |
