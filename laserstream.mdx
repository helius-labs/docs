## What is LaserStream?

LaserStream is a next-generation streaming service **purpose-built for developers who need reliable, low-latency Solana data**. It delivers on-chain events (transactions, slots, blocks, accounts, and more) directly to your application with industry-leading reliability, performance, and flexibility. Similar to our gRPC offerings, LaserStream nodes tap directly into Solana leaders to receive shreds as they're produced, delivering ultra-low latency data to your application.

Unlike standard Solana RPC nodes, LaserStream is specifically designed for streaming use cases, offering features not available in conventional node setups:

  <Card title="Historical Replay" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Automatically backfill missed data by specifying a starting slot, ensuring data continuity even after disconnections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Node Reliability" icon="server">
    Stream from multiple aggregated nodes simultaneously, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring maximum uptime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Performance" icon="bolt">
    Purpose-built for streaming with optimized connection handling, reducing latency and improving throughput compared to standard connections.

## Easy Migration

<Note>
**Drop-in Replacement**: LaserStream gRPC is designed as a seamless drop-in replacement for your existing gRPC setup. Simply change your endpoint and API token, and your application will work with LaserStream immediately.
</Note>

### Using Existing gRPC Code

If you already use Yellowstone gRPC, migrating to LaserStream is as simple as:

```typescript
// Before: Using standard Yellowstone gRPC
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "your-current-endpoint.com",
  { token: "your-current-token" }
);

// After: Using LaserStream (just change endpoint and token)
const connection = new GeyserConnection(
  "https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com", // Choose your closest region
  { token: "your-helius-api-key" }
);
```

### Enhanced Experience with the LaserStream SDK

While LaserStream works with your existing code, we highly recommend using our [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) for enhanced capabilities:

```typescript
// Using the dedicated LaserStream SDK
import { subscribe, CommitmentLevel, LaserstreamConfig } from 'helius-laserstream';

const config = {
  apiKey: "your-helius-api-key",
  endpoint: "https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com" // Choose your closest region
};

// The SDK automatically handles:
// - Connection management
// - Reconnection with backoff
// - Historical replay after disconnects
// - Subscription management
await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, handleData, handleError);
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Reconnection & Catch-up

The [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) automatically handles dropped connections, network issues, and data gaps. When a reconnection occurs, the SDK automatically:

- Reconnects with minimal delay
- Re-streams any data that was missed during the downtime
- Continues streaming without intervention

### Multi-Protocol Support

LaserStream is designed with multi-protocol support in mind:

| Protocol | Status | Best For | Features | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **gRPC** | ✅ Available | Backend services, high-throughput applications | Highest performance, binary protocol, bi-directional streaming | Via LaserStream SDK or Yellowstone |
| **WebSocket** | 🔜 Coming soon | Frontend applications, browser clients | JSON-based, widely supported in browsers, familiar for web developers | Standard WebSocket clients (e.g., `ws` library) |

<Note>
**WebSocket support is coming soon!** Currently, LaserStream is available only via gRPC. WebSocket integration is under active development and will be available in a future update.
</Note>

### Advanced Filtering

LaserStream supports sophisticated filtering options:

- **Account Filtering**: Include, exclude, or require specific accounts
- **Transaction Types**: Filter by transaction status, vote transactions, etc.
- **Commitment Levels**: Choose from processed, confirmed, or finalized
- **Data Content**: Request specific data fields or full data

### Extreme Scalability

- **Load Balancing**: Connections distributed across multiple nodes
- **Auto-scaling**: Backend resources scale to match demand
- **Efficient Routing**: Requests automatically routed to the most responsive node

## Endpoints & Regions

LaserStream is available in multiple regions worldwide for optimal performance. Choose the endpoint closest to your application's location:

### Mainnet Endpoints

| Region | Location | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **ewr** | New York, US (East Coast) | `https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com` |
| **pitt** | Pittsburgh, US (Central) | `https://laserstream-mainnet-pitt.helius-rpc.com` |
| **slc** | Salt Lake City, US (West Coast) | `https://laserstream-mainnet-slc.helius-rpc.com` |
| **ams** | Amsterdam, Europe | `https://laserstream-mainnet-ams.helius-rpc.com` |
| **fra** | Frankfurt, Europe | `https://laserstream-mainnet-fra.helius-rpc.com` |
| **tyo** | Tokyo, Asia | `https://laserstream-mainnet-tyo.helius-rpc.com` |
| **sgp** | Singapore, Asia | `https://laserstream-mainnet-sgp.helius-rpc.com` |

### Devnet Endpoint

| Network | Location | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Devnet** | New York, US (East Coast) | `https://laserstream-devnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com` |

<Note>
**Choosing Your Network & Region**: 
- For **production applications**, use a mainnet endpoint closest to your server location. For example, if your server is in Frankfurt, use `https://laserstream-mainnet-fra.helius-rpc.com`.
- For **development and testing**, use the devnet endpoint: `https://laserstream-devnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com`.
</Note>

## Authentication & Availability

LaserStream uses your Helius API key for authentication. You can obtain your API key from the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/). Your API key serves as both your authentication token and grants access to LaserStream's enhanced features.

<Note>
**Plan Requirement**: LaserStream is available for **Professional plan** subscribers ($999/month). Professional plan users pay 3 credits per 0.1MB for all LaserStream usage. You can upgrade your plan in the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/).
</Note>

### Need High-Volume Streaming? LaserStream Plus Add-On

If you're building applications that consume massive amounts of real-time Solana data, the LaserStream Plus add-on transforms your costs:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
