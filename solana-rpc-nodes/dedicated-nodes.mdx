<Warning>
Dedicated nodes do not support staked connections, APIs, or webhooks. To use these features, you’ll need a standard paid plan. For full platform access, we recommend combining dedicated nodes with a paid plan.
</Warning>

Perfect for latency-sensitive applications such as data streaming or handling a high volume of requests, it's ideal for teams seeking a dedicated environment with consistent performance and cost management. Choose a single node in a specific location to enhance server-to-server interactions or establish a node cluster for wide geographic distribution. Enhance capabilities using advanced Geyser plugins.

## Node Options

- AMD EPYC 7443p
- AMD EPYC 7543p (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)
- AMD EPYC 9254 (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)

## Access Includes

- Standard RPC and WebSocket methods
- Premium support
- Node clients — Agave (recommended) or Jito Labs
- Geyser Plugin (Optional) — [Yellowstone](/data-streaming/yellowstone-grpc-geyser)

<Note>
  For trading teams and Telegram bots, we typically recommend purchasing
  Dedicated Nodes (lower latency) with the Yellowstone Geyser (gRPC) Plugin for
  streaming.
