Perfect for latency-sensitive applications such as data streaming or handling a high volume of requests, it's ideal for teams seeking a dedicated environment with consistent performance and cost management. Choose a single node in a specific location to enhance server-to-server interactions or establish a node cluster for wide geographic distribution. Enhance capabilities using advanced Geyser plugins.

## Node Options

- AMD EPYC 7443p
- AMD EPYC 7543p (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)
- AMD EPYC 9254 (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)

## Access Includes

- Standard RPC and WebSocket methods
- Premium support
- Node clients — Agave (recommended) or Jito Labs
- Geyser Plugin (Optional) — [Yellowstone](/data-streaming/yellowstone-grpc-geyser)

<Note>
  For trading teams and Telegram bots, we typically recommend purchasing
  Dedicated Nodes (lower latency) with the Yellowstone Geyser (gRPC) Plugin for
  streaming and [Dedicated Staked Connections](#dedicated-staked-connections)
  (optimized landing rates for
  [`sendTransaction`](/rpc/http/sendtransaction)).
</Note>

<Warning>
  Dedicated nodes cannot access staked connections, which greatly improves
  landing rates. You'll need access to a standard paid plan to use staked
  connections. Learn more here: [Sending Transactions on
  Solana](/sending-transactions/staked-connections).
</Warning>

## Dedicated Fleets

If your team needs a cluster of multiple Dedicated Nodes or needs to run a fleet of Pythnet nodes, [contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ). We'll review your requirements and help you with a custom solution.
