Most people use Solana block explorers to view and analyze transactions, allowing them to see what's happening on-chain. 

Wallets and DeFi applications integrate with block explorers to let their users confirm transaction status, view transaction histories, and better understand what's happening on-chain.

To [look up a Solana transaction on Orb](https://orb.helius.dev/), simply copy your transaction signature from your wallet or app's UI and paste it into Orb's search bar.

Let's look at a typical token swap. 

In this example, [USDC is swapped for ORE](https://orb.helius.dev/tx/52Vrdcyxp9TsfWByYdJ6nrufSBNi17oX6EmkftVcLd9YV2o4A86n8ZQCQpkvm68UyFX5eKUFfAm9PqPk5Pa7ZhXa?cluster=mainnet-beta&tab=summary) through Jupiter.

## AI Overview and Summary

If all you need is basic transaction information, read the summary or click the "Explain with AI" button to get a high-level overview of what happened in this transaction.

For example, clicking the **Explain with AI** button shows that this transaction involved swapping \$83,188 \$USDC for 546.97 \$ORE using the [Jupiter Aggregator v6 program](https://orb.helius.dev/address/JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4/history?cluster=mainnet-beta).

## Instruction Summary and Details

Scrolling down the page, the **Instruction Summary** shows all intermediate steps, such as transferring \$USDC from the owner's wallet to the Jupiter Aggregator Authority account.

Next, we see the summary **details** section:

## Transaction Balances

Clicking into the **Balances** tab, we can see a clear summary of the token balance changes for each address and market. 

We see the original wallet `3AWDT…WgBCu` is swapping USDC for ORE across multiple markets, including Orca, Goonfi, and Meteora DLMM, which processed parts of the trade.

## Transaction Instructions

Clicking into the **Instructions** tab, we can see that the transaction included calling the Compute Budget Program and the Jupiter Aggregator v6 program.

Expanding the Jupiter program, we see 15+ inner instructions, including invoking Solana's token program, Orca's Whirlpool Program, Meteora's DLMM Program, and the GoonFi program (a [Solana Prop AMM](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solanas-proprietary-amm-revolution)).

</Frame>

Looking at a single inner instruction (3.2), we see a Swap V2 action from the Orca Whirlpool Program involving 19945154880 tokens and a list of accounts involved in the transaction, including account 6 (the \$ORE token) and account 7 (the \$USDC token).

<Frame caption="The second inner instruction involves Jupiter’s Aggregator v6 program, invoking a swap between $USDC and $ORE on Orca’s Whirlpool Program.">

</Frame>

Looking at instruction 3.3, we see that the 19945154880 tokens translate to \$19,945.154880 USDC (because the \$USDC token has 6 decimals), and instruction 3.4 shows a token amount of 132.03968385902 \$ORE.

<Frame caption="The third and fourth inner instructions show the Transfer Checked action from Solana's token program for USDC and ORE respectively.">

## Transaction Instruction Logs

To inspect the transaction logs, click the **Logs** tab. Here we can view the logs emitted by each program, which typically display the name of the called instruction, the status (i.e., success/failure), and the number of compute units consumed.

## Raw Transaction JSON

For the most granular output, click the **Raw** tab. 

Here, you can see each instruction either as raw JSON output, which can be made more human-readable by enabling the "Helius Enhanced" toggle.

<Tip>
  Low-level instruction logs and raw outputs are most useful for developers debugging programs and for analysts trying to understand how programs work.

## Conclusion

Inspecting Solana transactions is a key use case for a blockchain explorer like [Orb](https://orb.helius.dev). 

From high-level confirmation statuses to low-level raw JSON outputs for debugging transactions, [top block explorers](https://www.helius.dev/blog/top-solana-block-explorers) like Orb give everyone the tools they need to read and analyze transactions on Solana.
