IDL stands for Interface Definition Language. In Solana, IDLs describe the structure of an on-chain program and express how other on-chain programs can compose with them. Orb has tagged hundreds of Solana programs to make it easier to find and compose with them.

For this example, let's use [DFlow's v4 aggregator program](https://orb.helius.dev/address/DF1ow4tspfHX9JwWJsAb9epbkA8hmpSEAtxXy1V27QBH/history?cluster=mainnet-beta). To find a Solana program, go to Orb's home page and search for the program by name in the search bar, and then click on the result.

## Program History

In the History section, you'll see all of the recent transactions. For more details on [how to inspect a transaction using a block explorer](/orb/explore-transactions), see our transaction exploration guide.

For the purposes of this guide, we'll dive straight to the IDL tab.

## Program IDL

The IDL viewer shows the parsed instructions, accounts, types, events, and errors. To view the raw JSON output, click the "Show JSON" toggle in the top right corner.

Expanding the dropdown menu reveals all required parameters and details.

For example, expanding the Types section reveals a list of swap actions related to various DEXs, such as WhirlpoolsSwap, ClearpoolsSwap, and RaydiumAmmSwap.

## Program Verification

A [verified program](https://solana.com/docs/programs/verified-builds) on Solana is a deployed program whose on-chain binary exactly matches the publicly available source code. This is typically done with tools like Ellipsis Labs' [verified build CLI](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build).

For this example, we'll use Privacy Cash, a Solana program for private token transfers. To view the verification status, hash, date, signer, and repository, simply click the Verification tab.

For more details, click the Show Structure button to view the complete repository layout. This view pulls in the verified build and enables you to see the full repository structure on Orb.

## Program Security.txt

A `security.txt` file is a standardized way for Solana programs to define their security policies, provide contact information for auditors, and establish clear guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Program Authority

On Solana, programs are upgradeable by default, and the power to upgrade a program's code lies with its upgrade authority. Looking at the Authority tab in DFlow's program, we see that the upgrade authority is a Squads multisig with a 2/2 threshold (i.e., exactly 2 signers must sign program upgrade transactions).

## Conclusion

Composability is one of Solana's greatest strengths. By publishing IDLs on-chain and verifying builds, any company building on Solana can permissionlessly interact with any other program deployed on-chain.
