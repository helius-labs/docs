Every 400ms, a [validator on Solana](https://www.helius.dev/validator) produces a new block that contains thousands of transactions, touching dozens of programs and executing millions of compute units.

Whether you're a validator operator wanting to analyze block rewards and transaction details or a researcher exploring on-chain data, Orb's block pages provide comprehensive visibility.

Let's look at an [example block](https://orb.helius.dev/block/378183037) (378,183,037) that was executed by the [Bitwise Onchain Slutions validator](https://orb.helius.dev/address/8GbwASqdpw4dVcwbWUxbHXMrjyQx2aKkoBR5H1GJF8iD/history?cluster=mainnet-beta), powered by Helius.

## Block Info

At the top of the **Blocks** page are details about the block leader, timestamp, epoch, total transactions (successful and failed), CUs, and block rewards.

<Note>
  Details about block rewards can also be found in the **Rewards** tab.

## Block Transactions

To inspect each transaction included in a block, select the **Transactions** tab. Here, you can see a list of transaction types, the programs invoked, and a link to the transaction signature.

## Block Programs

To view the program statistics in a given block, click the **Programs** tab. 

Here, you can see all the programs executed in the block, along with their total number of transactions, instruction percentage, and success rate.

The above screenshot shows that of the total 1,086 transactions in this block, 864 (74.93%) were vote transactions, leaving 222 non-vote transactions.

## Conclusion

Inspecting a block on Solana is one of the most fundamental use cases for a blockchain explorer like Orb. To get started, look up a block on [Orb](https://orb.helius.dev/), or view a stream of the most recent blocks on Orb's [Solana statistics page](https://orb.helius.dev/stats?cluster=mainnet-beta).
