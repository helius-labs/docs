### Tokenized Stocks

xStocks powered by Backed, which Kraken recently acquired, are synthetic tokens that track the price of stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and NFLX that are traded on traditional stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ.

While these stocks can’t be redeemed for the underlying stock, they do use [Token Extensions](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-token-2022), such as Scaled UI, to support stock activities like stock splits.

### Memecoins (Cults)

Because of Solana’s low fees, fast transaction times, and ability to handle massive scale, it has become the blockchain of choice for memecoins. 

While creators have launched millions of memecoins on Solana just this year, only a handful have developed cult-like followings, such as the official \$TRUMP memecoin, which led to [historic records of trading activity on Solana](https://www.helius.dev/blog/trump-solana-memecoin-records-trends-insights), iconic internet memes like Popcat, and memes created by AI agents like Truth Terminal’s \$FARTCOIN.
