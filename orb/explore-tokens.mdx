A common reason people use block explorers is to look up token details by entering a token's address, often called a "contract address" (CA) or, on Solana, more accurately, a token mint account.

Using block explorers like Orb, traders can explore a token's price, trading volume, number of holders, circulating token supply, markets, liquidity, token metadata, authority, and access trading charts.

Let's look at the [Solana token page for Ore](https://orb.helius.dev/address/oreoU2P8bN6jkk3jbaiVxYnG1dCXcYxwhwyK9jSybcp/history) (`oreoU2P8bN6jkk3jbaiVxYnG1dCXcYxwhwyK9jSybcp`).

## Solana Token Overview

At the top of every token page, you see the most important, high-level token metrics, including:

- Token name, icon, and address
- Website and links to social media
- Total token supply and market cap
- Verification status and links to trading charts
- Token price, holder count, and trading volume

## Token Transaction History

The History tab shows a list of the token's recent activity, including transaction types, summaries, execution time, programs invoked, and transaction signatures.

Selecting "Filters" opens a panel with options to filter by:

- Status (e.g., success/fail)
- Token (e.g., USDC)
- Program (e.g., DFlow Aggregator v4)

<Tip>
You can also hide spam and sort results by oldest first to view a token's earliest transactions.

## Token Markets

Click the Markets tab to view all liquidity pairs (e.g., ORE-SOL, ORE-USDC), trading venues (e.g., Orca, Meteora DLMM), and metrics including 24-hour volume, number of trades, and number of unique traders.

## Token Holders

Traders may want to verify that a token's supply isn't highly concentrated in a small number of holders. Clicking the Holders tab in Orb lets you quickly analyze the top wallets, their supply percentages, and values.

## Token Metadata

To view or copy any Solana token's metadata, click the Metadata tab. The JSON view will provide the token's key information including links, descriptions, royalties, ownership details, and token info (e.g., ticker, supply, decimals, and mint authority).

## Token Authority

Authorities define the control and permissions (e.g., minting new tokens, freezing accounts, and modifying properties) of a token on Solana. Click the Authority tab to view the authorities and implications.

## Conclusion

There are millions of tokens on Solana, with thousands of new launches every day. Learning how to review token authorities, holders, price, and metadata is a fundamental use case for Solana blockchain explorers like Orb. To get started, simply [search for a Solana token by name or address on Orb](https://orb.helius.dev/).
