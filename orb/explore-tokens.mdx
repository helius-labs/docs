A common reason people use [Solana explorers](https://www.helius.dev/blog/top-solana-block-explorers) is to look up Solana token details by entering the token's address, often called a "contract address" (CA) or, on Solana, more accurately, a token mint account.

Using [Orb](https://orb.helius.dev), traders can explore a token's price, trading volume, number of holders, circulating token supply, markets, liquidity, token metadata, authority, and access trading charts.

In the below example, we'll look at the [Solana token page for \$ORE](https://orb.helius.dev/address/oreoU2P8bN6jkk3jbaiVxYnG1dCXcYxwhwyK9jSybcp/history):

Address: (`oreoU2P8bN6jkk3jbaiVxYnG1dCXcYxwhwyK9jSybcp`)

## Solana Token Overview

At the top of every token page, you see the most important metrics, including:

- Token name, icon, and address
- Website and links to social media
- Total token supply and market cap
- Verification status and links to trading charts
- Token price, holder count, and trading volume

## Token Transaction History

The **History** tab shows a list of the token's recent activity, including transaction types, summaries, execution time, programs invoked, and transaction signatures.

Selecting "Filters" opens a panel with options to filter by:

- Status (e.g., success/fail)
- Token (e.g., USDC)
- Program (e.g., DFlow Aggregator v4)

<Tip>
  You can also hide spam and sort results by oldest first to view a token's earliest transactions.

## Token Markets

Click the **Markets** tab to view all liquidity pairs (e.g., ORE-SOL, ORE-USDC), trading venues (e.g., Orca, Meteora DLMM), and metrics including liquidity, 24-hour volume, total number of trades, and number of unique traders.

## Token Holders

Traders may want to verify that a token's supply isn't highly concentrated in a small number of holders. Clicking the **Holders** tab in Orb lets you quickly analyze the top wallets, their supply percentages, and value (denominated in US dollars).

## Token Metadata

To view or copy any Solana token's metadata, click the **Metadata** tab in Orb. 

The JSON view gives the token's key information, including links, descriptions, royalties, ownership details, and token info (e.g., ticker, supply, decimals, and mint authority).

## Token Authority

Authorities define the control and permissions (e.g., minting new tokens, freezing accounts, and modifying properties) of a token on Solana. 

Clicking the **Authority** tab we can see ORE's token authorities and implications.

## Conclusion

There are millions of tokens on Solana, with thousands of new launches every day. Learning how to review token authorities, holders, price, and metadata is a fundamental use case for Solana blockchain explorers like Orb. 

To get started, simply [search for a Solana token](https://orb.helius.dev/) by name or address on Orb.
