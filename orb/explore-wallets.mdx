Orb is fast, human-readable blockchain explorer that can be used as a [<u>Solana wallet explorer</u>](https://orb.helius.dev). 

With Orb, you can track any wallet address, see who funded it, find any SNS domains, view token accounts, balances, NFTs, transaction histories, and more.

This tutorial will cover all of the ways you can use Orb as a Solana wallet checker and explorer.

## How to Explore Solana Wallets

The primary functions of a Solana wallet explorer are to easily find tokens, balances, collectibles, and transaction histories.

Wallet explorers are also valuable tools for finding specific historical transactions for filing taxes, determining the dates assets were purchased, calculating PnLs, and more.

### Wallet Tracker Overview

To find a wallet on Orb, enter the wallet address or decentralized domain name in the search bar. Once you click the result, you’ll be taken to the wallet explorer page.

At the top of the page, you’ll see the wallet’s address and a summary for the wallet, including its total value, SOL balance, and token balance denominated in both SOL and USD.

### Track Who Funded a Solana Wallet

To the right of the Solana wallet address on Orb, you'll find a section labeled **Funded by**. This shows which wallet or tagged exchange account funded the wallet, along with the date. 

<Frame caption="Explore the address that originally funded your Solana wallet">

</Frame>

To visit the funding address, click the address or the tagged exchange account’s name. To view the funding transaction, click the “open in new window” icon. 

This feature is particularly useful when you’re trying to connect suspicious activity. For example, if you notice inorganic trading on a token, you can see where the funds originated from.

In some cases, you can identify a single origin wallet that is connected to multiple different wallets trading on a single token.

### Find Solana Domain Names

Solana domains make sending and receiving assets on Solana easier by registering a wallet’s public key with a human-readable .sol address.

Instead of copying/pasting the full wallet address into apps, you can simply type the .sol domain or AllDomains ID and it will resolve to its registered wallet address.

In the top-right corner of the wallet explorer page, you can find all of the SNS domains registered to the current wallet. For this example, we’re using god.sol, a well-known Solana memecoin trader.

### Check Your Wallet’s Tokens and Balances

A primary use case for wallet explorers on Solana is to view the tokens your wallet holds, their quantities, and their values. To do this on Orb, click the **Tokens** tab. 

In this section, you will find the token name, icon, and mint address, balance, value, and price. Expanding the drop-down menu, you can see the wallets' most recent transactions for each token.

</Frame>

Orb’s wallet explorer automatically filters out non-verified tokens. This is particularly useful if your wallet contains a lot of spam tokens, which may artificially inflate the total value of your wallet. To see unverified tokens, simply deselect the verified option.

### Explore NFTs in Your Wallet

Click the **NFTs** tab to view the NFTs in your wallet, and use filters to remove spam. To filter your view more, enable the Metaplex verified toggle or choose a collection from the dropdown menu.

### Monitor Wallet Stake Accounts

To see if your wallet has any stake accounts, click the **Stake** tab. 

This section will show your wallet’s total stake, staking status (e.g., active, activating, deactivating, inactive), the validator you’re staking to, stake amount, and the validator’s commission rate.

To stake SOL with Helius, Solana’s #1 validator, visit the [<u>Orb staking portal</u>](https://orb.helius.dev/stake).

### Analyze Solana Wallet Transaction History

Orb’s wallet explorer also contains a history of transactions and transfers so you can look at recent history. To find specific transactions, apply one of Orb’s many wallet filtering options:

- Transfer Direction: incoming or outgoing
- Date Range: look at transactions from a specific period
- To/From: limit results to or from a specific address
- Tokens: filter transactions by specific tokens
- Programs: filter transactions by programs
- Spam: hide spam transfers and transactions
- Show Oldest First: look up results in reverse

### Look Up Solana Wallet Transactions with Heatmaps

To see a calendar view of all the days your wallet transacted on Solana, click the **Heatmap** tab. 

Like the GitHub contribution graph, Orb’s transaction heatmap shows the last 6 months of activity with more active days in a bright orange and less active days in lighter shades of orange.

<Frame caption="Transaction heatmap viewer on the Orb Solana wallet explorer">

</Frame>

Hover over any day to see the total transactions, and click it to view a filtered list of that day’s transactions.

<Note>
  \*\*Note: \*\*Transaction heatmaps have a limit of 5,000 transactions per account.
