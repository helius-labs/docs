## Best Practices

### Primary Use: gRPC Streaming

**Dedicated nodes are optimized for gRPC streaming applications**. For the best experience:

* **Use with Yellowstone Geyser Plugin**: This is the primary and recommended use case for dedicated nodes
* **Combine with a shared plan**: For `sendTransaction`, archival data, and complex account queries, use your shared plan endpoints
* **Focus on streaming**: Leverage dedicated nodes for real-time data streaming, monitoring, and analytics

### Managing Node Load

While nodes don't have strict usage limits, they are bound by hardware constraints. A balanced workload helps maintain optimal performance and node liveliness.

* **Use `getProgramAccounts` carefully**: While supported, dedicated nodes are not optimized for these calls - heavy usage can impact performance or cause node failure
  * Use your shared plan for `getProgramAccounts` queries as we have a [**custom indexer**](https://x.com/heliuslabs/status/1864750969755422797) that makes those calls much faster and more reliable
* **Poor transaction landing rates**: While `sendTransaction` is supported, it's not optimized - most transactions will not land; use your shared plan for reliable transaction submission
* **No archival queries**: Historical data access should be done through your shared plan
* Monitor your node's metrics to understand its performance based on response times, successful request %, and error counts
* Consider distributing intensive workloads across multiple nodes in a dedicated fleet

<Warning>
**Remember**: Dedicated nodes limitations:
- `sendTransaction` supported but not optimized - most transactions will not land
- No archival data access  
- `getProgramAccounts` supported but not optimized - heavy usage can impact performance or cause node failure
- No platform APIs, webhooks, or staked connections

Use your shared paid plan for these features.
</Warning>

<Note>
If your team needs a cluster of multiple dedicated nodes, [contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ). We will take in your requirements and configure a dedicated fleet for your team.
</Note>

### System Recovery

Our nodes include an automatic recovery mechanism:

* If a node falls too far behind in processing slots, it will automatically initiate a restart
* During this recovery period, all requests are seamlessly routed to our shared backup pool
* Once your node catches up and becomes healthy, traffic will resume to it

### Questions and Support

* Contact us through your Telegram group (available for dedicated node customers)
* You can also get support from the chat system on our website or in our Discord server
