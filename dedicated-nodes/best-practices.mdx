## Best Practices

### Managing Node Load

While nodes don't have strict usage limits, they are bound by hardware constraints. A balanced workload helps maintain optimal performance and node liveliness.

* Avoid mixing heavy account-based calls (e.g. [getProgramAccounts](/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts), [getTokenAccountsByOwner](/rpc/http/gettokenaccountsbyowner), etc.) with gRPC usage on the same node.
  * It's best to move heavy account-based calls to a shared plan since we have a [**custom indexer**](https://x.com/heliuslabs/status/1864750969755422797) that makes those calls much faster.
* Monitor your node's metrics to understand its performance based on response times, successful request %, and error counts.
* Consider distributing intensive workloads across multiple nodes in a dedicated fleet

<Note>
If your team needs a cluster of multiple dedicated nodes, [contact our sales team](https://form.typeform.com/to/KiacmxpZ). We will take in your requirements and configure a dedicated fleet for your team.

### System Recovery

Our nodes include an automatic recovery mechanism:

* If a node falls too far behind in processing slots, it will automatically initiate a restart
* During this recovery period, all requests are seamlessly routed to our shared backup pool
* Once your node catches up and becomes healthy, traffic will resume to it

### Questions and Support

* Contact us through your Telegram group (available for dedicated node customers)
* You can also get support from the chat system on our website or in our Discord server
