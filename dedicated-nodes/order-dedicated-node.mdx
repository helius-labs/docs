Dedicated Nodes can be ordered directly from the [developer portal](https://dashboard.helius.dev/dedicated-nodes) on the Dedicated Nodes tab.

## Node Type

The type of node you choose depends on your specific project requirements. Reviewing each node's CPU cores and RAM is important to determine which will best support your workload. Since we don't impose any rate limits, your node's performance will rely entirely on its specifications.

If you plan to make resource-intensive calls (e.g., [`getProgramAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts), [`getTokenLargestAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenlargestaccounts), [`getTokenAccountsByDelegate`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenaccountsbydelegate), [`getTokenAccountsByOwner`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenaccountsbyowner), [`getLargestAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/getlargestaccounts)), the AMD EPYC 7543p and AMD EPYC 9254 offer similar performance, but the EPYC 9254 is newer and more efficient.

The AMD EPYC 7443p is better if your workload does not require resource-intensive calls.

## Node Location

We offer nodes across multiple regions: in North America (Pittsburgh, Newark, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Vancouver); in Europe (Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt); and in Asia (Tokyo, Singapore) to ensure the best geographic coverage with the global Solana infrastructure.

For optimal latency, choose a node closest to your server. Your node will be deployed within three hours of payment.

## Node Client

You can customize your node by selecting the client type — either Agave or Jito Labs (fork of Agave with an additional method `simulateBundle`)

<Note>
Dedicated nodes **cannot** send Jito Bundles on their own. To send Jito Bundles, you must use the Jito API, which handles packaging and sending the bundles through Jito's system.

To simplify this process, our SDK provides an easy method called [Send Jito Bundle](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#sendJitoBundle).
</Note>

## Geyser Plugin (Optional)

Add optional features like the [Yellowstone](https://github.com/helius-labs/yellowstone-grpc) Geyser Plugin, which supports [streaming](/grpc) of slots, blocks, transactions, and account updates.

<Note>
  We recommend running Geyser and RPC operations on separate nodes for optimal
  performance.
</Note>

## Payment Options

You can pay via fiat or crypto (USDC). Once your payment goes through, your node will be deployed within 3 hours.

For billing, fiat payments will receive a discount on the next month's bill for the number of days it took to provision the node. For crypto payments, the billing cycle starts once the node is delivered.
