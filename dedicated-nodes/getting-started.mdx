## How to Order Dedicated Nodes

Dedicated Nodes can be ordered directly from the [developer portal](https://dashboard.helius.dev/dedicated-nodes) on the Dedicated Nodes tab.

### Node Type

The type of node you choose depends on your specific project requirements. Reviewing each node's CPU cores and RAM is important to determine which will best support your workload. Since we don't impose any rate limits, your node's performance will rely entirely on its specifications.

If you plan to make resource-intensive calls (e.g., [`getProgramAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts), [`getTokenLargestAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenlargestaccounts), [`getTokenAccountsByDelegate`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenaccountsbydelegate), [`getTokenAccountsByOwner`](/api-reference/rpc/http/gettokenaccountsbyowner), [`getLargestAccounts`](/api-reference/rpc/http/getlargestaccounts)), the AMD EPYC 7543p and AMD EPYC 9254 offer similar performance, but the EPYC 9254 is newer and more efficient.

The AMD EPYC 7443p is better if your workload does not require resource-intensive calls.

### Node Location

We offer nodes across multiple regions: in North America (Pittsburgh, Newark, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Vancouver); in Europe (Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt); and in Asia (Tokyo, Singapore) to ensure the best geographic coverage with the global Solana infrastructure.

For optimal latency, choose a node closest to your server. Your node will be deployed within three hours of payment.

### Node Client

You can customize your node by selecting the client type — either Agave or Jito Labs (fork of Agave with an additional method `simulateBundle`)

  />
</Frame>

<Note>
Dedicated nodes **cannot** send Jito Bundles on their own. To send Jito Bundles, you must use the Jito API, which handles packaging and sending the bundles through Jito's system.

To simplify this process, our SDK provides an easy method called [Send Jito Bundle](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#sendJitoBundle).
</Note>

### Geyser Plugin (Optional)

Add optional features like the [Yellowstone](https://github.com/helius-labs/yellowstone-grpc) Geyser Plugin, which supports [streaming](/grpc) of slots, blocks, transactions, and account updates.

    alt="Select the Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin (Optional)"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  We recommend running Geyser and RPC operations on separate nodes for optimal
  performance.
</Note>

### Payment Options

You can pay via fiat or crypto (USDC). Once your payment goes through, your node will be deployed within 3 hours.

For billing, fiat payments will receive a discount on the next month's bill for the number of days it took to provision the node. For crypto payments, the billing cycle starts once the node is delivered.

## Getting Started

Once you have your Dedicated Node set up and ready (status: **Succeeded**), you can start working with it. For information about the dashboard and managing your node, see the [Dashboard](/dedicated-nodes/dashboard) page.

## Connecting to your dedicated node

### RPC and Websocket

Each dedicated node comes with an RPC URL that you can use like in the example below.

Here we are using Solana web3.js to call [`getSlot`](/api-reference/rpc/http/getslot) using our dedicated node:

```javascript
// Using @solana/web3.js
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

const connection = new Connection('https://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated.helius-rpc.com?api-key=465964ff-f718-47d2-a51c-66ddcce332d7');

// Get the current slot
const getSlot = async () => {
    const slot = await connection.getSlot();
    console.log('Current slot:', slot);
};

getSlot();
```

This is how you would set up a native websocket connection to stream new slots:

```javascript
const Websocket = require('ws');
const ws = new Websocket('wss://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated.helius-rpc.com?api-key=465964ff-f718-47d2-a51c-66ddcce332d7	');

ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id: 1,
        method: 'slotSubscribe'
    }));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
};
```

### Set up your Geyser Plugin

To begin using the Geyser plugin you need to clone the Yellowstone repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/helius-labs/yellowstone-grpc.git
```

#### Using the CLI

```sh
cd yellowstone-grpc/examples/rust/
cargo run --bin client -- -e "https://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated-lb.helius-rpc.com:2053" --x-token 42f03938-1daa-4162-a457-bb551ecaf590 subscribe --slots
```

Once complete, you should see the terminal output new slots. Don't forget to replace the URL and Token with your own.

### TypeScript Example

This example streams all Raydium transactions live in JSON format:

```typescript
import Client, { CommitmentLevel, SubscribeRequest } from "@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc";
import * as bs58 from 'bs58';

const processBuffers = (obj: any): any =>
  !obj ? obj :
  Buffer.isBuffer(obj) || obj instanceof Uint8Array ? bs58.encode(obj) :
  Array.isArray(obj) ? obj.map(processBuffers) :
  typeof obj === 'object' ? Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).map(([k, v]) => [k, processBuffers(v)])) :
  obj;

const main = async () => {
  const client = new Client("grpc_url", 
    "x_token", 
    { "grpc.max_receive_message_length": 64 * 1024 * 1024 });

  const stream = await client.subscribe();
  const write = (req: SubscribeRequest) => new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => 
    stream.write(req, (err) => err ? reject(err) : resolve()));

  stream.on("data", (data) => {
    try { console.log(JSON.stringify(processBuffers(data), null, 2)); }
    catch (e) { console.error('Error:', e); }
  });

  await write({
    slots: {},
    accounts: {},
    accountsDataSlice: [],
    transactions: {
      allRaydiumTxs: {
        accountInclude: ["675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8"],
        accountExclude: [],
        accountRequired: [],
      }
    },
    blocks: {},
    blocksMeta: {},
    entry: {},
    commitment: CommitmentLevel.PROCESSED,
  });

  setInterval(() => write({
    ping: { id: 1 },
    accounts: {},
    accountsDataSlice: [],
    transactions: {},
    blocks: {},
    blocksMeta: {},
    entry: {},
    slots: {},
  }).catch(console.error), 30000);

  await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    stream.on("error", (e) => { console.error("Stream error:", e); reject(e); stream.end(); });
    stream.on("end", resolve);
    stream.on("close", resolve);
  });
};

main().catch(console.error);
```
