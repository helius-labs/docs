title: 'Event Listening'
sidebarTitle: Overview
description: 'Event listening allows you to monitor and respond to blockchain events in real-time without constant polling. Helius provides robust event listening capabilities through webhooks and websockets that notify your application when specific blockchain events occur.'

## Why Use Event Listening?

- **Real-time Updates**: Receive instant notifications when blockchain events occur
- **Reduced Infrastructure Costs**: Eliminate the need for constant polling
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle high volumes of events efficiently
- **Flexible Event Filtering**: Configure exactly which events you want to monitor

## Available Event Listening Options

### Webhooks

[Webhooks](/webhooks) are HTTP callbacks that deliver data to your application when events occur on the Solana blockchain. They're ideal for:

- Tracking token transfers
- Monitoring NFT activities
- Detecting program interactions
- Receiving notifications about account changes

Helius webhooks deliver comprehensive event data with detailed transaction information, making it easy to build reactive applications that respond to on-chain activity.

### Websockets

[Websockets](/rpc/websocket) provide a persistent connection between your application and the Solana blockchain, allowing for real-time bidirectional communication. They're particularly useful for:

- Applications requiring immediate updates
- User interfaces that need to reflect blockchain state in real-time
- Cases where lower latency is critical
- Scenarios requiring continuous data streaming

Unlike webhooks, websockets maintain an open connection, eliminating HTTP overhead for each event delivery and providing faster notifications.

## Choosing Between Webhooks and Websockets

- **Use Webhooks when**: You need reliable delivery with retry mechanisms, prefer a stateless approach, or want to process events asynchronously.

- **Use Websockets when**: You need lowest possible latency, require bidirectional communication, or are building highly interactive applications.

## Getting Started

To begin using event listening capabilities:

1. For webhooks: [Create a webhook](/webhooks) configured for your specific use case
2. For websockets: [Connect to our websocket endpoint](/rpc/websocket)
3. Set up your application to process the incoming events
4. Implement appropriate business logic based on the events received

For common questions about implementation, check our [Webhooks FAQ](/webhooks) or [Websockets FAQ](/rpc/websocket).

## Use Cases

- **NFT Marketplaces**: Track listing, sales, and transfers in real-time
- **Wallets**: Notify users of incoming transactions
- **DeFi Applications**: Monitor trades, liquidity changes, and protocol events
- **Gaming**: Capture in-game actions stored on-chain
- **Analytics Platforms**: Aggregate transaction data as it happens
