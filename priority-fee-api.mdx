## What Are Priority Fees?

On Solana, priority fees allow your transactions to jump ahead in the validator queue during network congestion. Think of them as express lanes for your transactions.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Base Fees vs Priority Fees" icon="coins">
    **Base fees** are fixed costs for transaction processing
    
    **Priority fees** are optional payments for faster processing
  </Card>
  <Card title="How They Work" icon="rocket">
    You set a price per compute unit - higher prices get processed first during network congestion

## Why Use Priority Fees

Priority fees are now a standard part of Solana transactions, helping ensure reliable confirmation times and optimal network performance.

## Priority Levels Explained

Our API provides six priority levels based on recent network activity:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Min">
    **Lowest observed fee** - Based on minimum fees seen in recent slots
    
    **Best for**: Non-urgent transactions when cost optimization is priority
    
    **Note**: May result in slower confirmation times
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Low">
    **25th percentile** - Budget-friendly option with reasonable confirmation times
    
    **Best for**: Standard operations where speed isn't critical
    
    **Note**: Good balance of cost and reliability
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Medium (Recommended)">
    **50th percentile** - Median fee providing reliable confirmation times
    
    **Best for**: Most applications and general use cases
    
    **Note**: Recommended starting point for most developers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High">
    **75th percentile** - Higher fees for faster processing
    
    **Best for**: Time-sensitive operations and competitive scenarios
    
    **Note**: Prioritized processing during network activity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="VeryHigh">
    **95th percentile** - Premium fees for maximum speed
    
    **Best for**: Critical operations, MEV strategies, urgent transactions
    
    **Note**: Fast confirmation even during high network activity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="UnsafeMax">
    **Maximum observed** - Highest fees seen in recent slots
    
    **Best for**: Emergency situations only
    
    **Warning**: Often unnecessarily high - use with caution
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Cost Calculation**: Total priority fee = Price per compute unit × Compute units consumed

A typical transaction uses 200,000-400,000 compute units. At current Medium level (~40,000 microlamports per unit), that's 0.000008-0.000016 SOL in priority fees. Always check current network conditions for accurate estimates.

## Implementation Methods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Serialized Transaction (Recommended)" icon="file-code" href="/priority-fee/estimating-fees-using-serialized-transaction">
    **Primary Method** - Analyzes your exact transaction for maximum accuracy
    
    **Best for**: Most applications and production use cases
    
    **Benefits**: 
    - Instruction-specific analysis
    - Highest accuracy
    - Production-ready
    - Considers transaction complexity
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Account Keys (Advanced)" icon="key" href="/priority-fee/estimating-fees-using-account-keys">
    **Specialized Use Cases** - Estimates based on account patterns
    
    **Best for**: Pre-transaction analysis, batch operations, specialized architectures
    
    **Benefits**:
    - Account-level pattern analysis
    - Useful for planning and research
    - Batch account analysis

## Quick Start Example

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
import { Transaction, SystemProgram, ComputeBudgetProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import bs58 from "bs58";

// 1. Build your transaction (without priority fee)
const transaction = new Transaction();
const transferIx = SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: senderKeypair.publicKey,
  toPubkey: recipientPublicKey,
  lamports: 1000000, // 0.001 SOL
});
transaction.add(transferIx);

// 2. Set required fields and serialize
transaction.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getLatestBlockhash()).blockhash;
transaction.feePayer = senderKeypair.publicKey;
const serializedTx = bs58.encode(transaction.serialize());

// 3. Get priority fee estimate
const response = await fetch("https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    id: "1",
    method: "getPriorityFeeEstimate",
    params: [{
      transaction: serializedTx,
      options: { 
        priorityLevel: "Medium",
        recommended: true 
      }
    }]
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
const priorityFee = result.result.priorityFeeEstimate;

// 4. Add priority fee and send
transaction.instructions = []; // Reset
transaction.add(ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitPrice({ microLamports: priorityFee }));
transaction.add(transferIx);
transaction.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getLatestBlockhash()).blockhash;
transaction.sign(senderKeypair);
```

```python Python
import requests
import base58
from solana.transaction import Transaction
from solana.system_program import transfer, TransferParams

# 1. Build and serialize your transaction
# (transaction building code here)
serialized_tx = base58.b58encode(transaction.serialize()).decode('utf-8')

# 2. Get priority fee estimate
response = requests.post(
    "https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY",
    json={
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "1",
        "method": "getPriorityFeeEstimate",
        "params": [{
            "transaction": serialized_tx,
            "options": {
                "priorityLevel": "Medium",
                "recommended": True
            }
        }]
    }
)

result = response.json()
priority_fee = result["result"]["priorityFeeEstimate"]
print(f"Recommended priority fee: {priority_fee} micro-lamports")

# 3. Rebuild transaction with priority fee and send
```

```curl cURL
curl -X POST "https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "getPriorityFeeEstimate",
    "params": [{
      "transaction": "SERIALIZED_TRANSACTION_BASE58",
      "options": {
        "priorityLevel": "Medium",
        "recommended": true
      }
    }]

## Real-Time Network Monitoring

<Tip>
**Pro tip**: Monitor network conditions to optimize your priority fee strategy. During normal conditions, use lower priority levels. During congestion, consider higher levels for time-sensitive operations.

You can check current network conditions using Solana explorers or the `getRecentPerformanceSamples` RPC method.
