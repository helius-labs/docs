## What is Data Streaming on Solana?

Data streaming allows applications to receive real-time updates from the Solana blockchain as events occur on-chain. Instead of repeatedly polling for updates, streaming establishes persistent connections that push data to your application instantly when transactions are processed, accounts change, or blocks are produced.

This is essential for applications that require up-to-the-second data such as:

- **Trading applications** monitoring price changes and liquidations
- **DeFi protocols** tracking user interactions and state changes  
- **NFT marketplaces** detecting sales, listings, and transfers
- **Analytics platforms** collecting comprehensive blockchain metrics
- **Wallets** showing real-time balance and transaction updates
