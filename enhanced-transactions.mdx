<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parse Transaction(s)" icon="code" href="/enhanced-transactions/parse-transactions">
    Parse individual or multiple transactions to get human-readable data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction History" icon="clock-rotate-left" href="/enhanced-transactions/transaction-history">
    Get historical transaction data for any address
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Quick Reference**:
- `/v0/transactions` - Parse individual or multiple transaction signatures
- `/v0/addresses/{address}/transactions` - Get transaction history for an address
- Filter by transaction type using the `type` parameter (e.g., `NFT_SALE`, `SWAP`, `TRANSFER`)
</Note>

<Warning>
**Important Limitations**:
- Enhanced Transaction API V1 won't be updated while we are working on V2
- We only parse NFT, Jupiter, and SPL-related transactions
- **Do not rely on these parsers for DeFi or non-NFT, Jupiter, and SPL transactions**
</Warning>

## Overview

The Enhanced Transactions API transforms complex Solana transactions into human-readable data. Instead of dealing with raw instruction data and account lists, you get structured information about:

- What happened in the transaction (transfers, swaps, NFT activities)
- Which accounts were involved
- How much SOL or tokens were transferred
- Timestamps and other metadata
