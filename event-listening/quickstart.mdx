This guide will walk you through setting up your first event listener with Helius.

## Prerequisites

- A Helius API key (Get one from the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev))
- A webhook endpoint that can receive POST requests (for webhook listeners)

## Setup Options

Helius offers two primary methods for event listening:

1. **Webhooks** - Receive notifications when specific blockchain events occur
2. **WebSockets** - Real-time event streaming for responsive applications

## Quick Setup: Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://api.helius.xyz/v0/webhooks' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "accountAddresses": ["YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"],
        "transactionTypes": ["ANY"],
        "webhookURL": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
        "authHeader": {"key": "value"}, // optional
        "webhookType": "enhanced"
      }' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Receipt">
    Events matching your criteria will be sent to your webhook URL as POST requests. The payload will include:

    ```json
    {
      "accountData": [],
      "description": "",
      "events": {},
      "fee": 5000,
      "feePayer": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS",
      "signature": "TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE",
      "slot": 1234567,
      "timestamp": 1234567890000,
      "type": "TRANSACTION_TYPE"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Setup: WebSockets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to WebSocket Endpoint">
    ```javascript
    const WebSocket = require('ws');

    // Connect to Helius WebSocket endpoint
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.helius.xyz/v0/webhook-events?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY');
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Event Handlers">
    ```javascript
    // Handle connection open
    ws.on('open', () => {
      console.log('Connected to Helius WebSocket');
    });

    // Handle incoming messages
    ws.on('message', (data) => {
      const event = JSON.parse(data);
      console.log('Received event:', event);
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
