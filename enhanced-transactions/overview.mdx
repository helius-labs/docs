## Overview

The Enhanced Transactions API transforms complex Solana transactions into human-readable data. Instead of dealing with raw instruction data and account lists, you get structured information about:

- What happened in the transaction (transfers, swaps, NFT activities)
- Which accounts were involved
- How much SOL or tokens were transferred
- Timestamps and other metadata
