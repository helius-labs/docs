## Purchasing a Plan with Crypto 💲

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I want to switch between fiat and crypto payments.

Please contact our [support](https://discord.com/invite/6GXdee3gBj) team, and they will assist you with changing your payment method.

### I paid for a plan, but it hasn't been updated yet in my dashboard.

It can take up to **1 hour** for the system to update your plan. If it still doesn't update after that, reach out to our [support](https://discord.com/invite/6GXdee3gBj) team.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel by going to the [Billing](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) page and clicking the **Cancel Subscription** button.

### What does "Authorize Automatic Withdrawals" mean?

When you authorize automatic withdrawals, you're giving the platform permission to pull the necessary amount of USDC (on Solana) directly from your wallet whenever a new billing period starts. This is often referred to as a "subscription" or "recurring payment," where you don't have to manually approve each individual charge.

* **How It Works:**
  * At the beginning of each billing cycle, the system checks if you have enough USDC in your Solana wallet.
  * If sufficient funds are available, the required amount is automatically deducted to cover the plan's cost.
  * If you ever want to stop automatic charges, you can revoke this authorization via your wallet or billing settings.

* **Why Authorize?**
  * It saves you from having to manually make a payment every month (or billing period).
  * It ensures your service continues without interruption, as the payment is handled automatically.

* **Things to Keep in Mind:**
  * **Sufficient Funds:** Make sure your wallet has enough USDC ahead of each billing date.
  * **Revoking Authorization:** You can usually disable or revoke this automatic withdrawal at any time if you decide you'd rather pay manually.

### How can I manually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing payments?

Manual payments are not supported. You must authorize USDC so it can be automatically deducted on billing days. However, you can **revoke** this authorization after each purchase by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Billing Page](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) and select the subscription plan that fits your needs (e.g., Business). Choose either **monthly** or **annual** billing.
2. Select your plan (e.g., Developer).
3. Click **Edit** in the Authorization section.
4. Set the limit to **0** to revoke authorization.

Go to the [Billing](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) page and click **Manage Delegate Wallet** (this will redirect you to Loop).
