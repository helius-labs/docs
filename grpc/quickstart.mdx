## Introduction

With Dedicated Node, you can leverage the powerful Yellowstone gRPC interface to receive real-time updates about on-chain events. The Geyser plugin provides a high-performance, low-latency stream of Solana blockchain data.

<Info>
  Yellowstone gRPC provides real-time data streams with high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for applications that need immediate access to on-chain events.

## What is gRPC and Why Use It?

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a modern, high-performance framework that enables client and server applications to communicate transparently. For Solana blockchain data streaming, gRPC offers several key advantages:

<Card title="Key Advantages" icon="stars">
  1. **Language Agnostic**: Using Protocol Buffers (protobuf), gRPC allows you to write clients in multiple programming languages while maintaining type safety and consistency.
  
  2. **Binary Protocol**: Unlike JSON-based REST APIs, gRPC uses a binary protocol that is more efficient in terms of bandwidth and parsing overhead.
  
  3. **Bi-directional Streaming**: gRPC supports bi-directional streaming, perfect for receiving continuous updates about blockchain events.
  
  4. **Type Safety**: The protobuf schema ensures type safety across all supported languages.

## Getting Started

Your Helius Dedicated Node exposes the Yellowstone gRPC interface on port 2053. The service provides various subscription options for different types of blockchain data:

### Installation & Project Setup

Before diving into specific examples in the following sections, let's set up our development environment for each supported language:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript/JavaScript">
    1. Create a new project:

    ```bash
    mkdir ts-yellowstone-client
    cd ts-yellowstone-client
    npm init -y
    ```

    2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install @triton-one/yellowstone-grpc bs58
    npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
    ```

    3. Create TypeScript configuration:

    ```bash
    npx tsc --init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rust">
    1. Create a new project:

    ```bash
    cargo new rust-yellowstone-client
    cd rust-yellowstone-client
    ```

    2. Add to `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    yellowstone-grpc-client = "1.13.0"
    yellowstone-grpc-proto = "1.13.0"
    tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
    anyhow = "1.0"
    futures = "0.3"
    tonic = "0.10"
    tonic-health = "0.10"
    hex = "0.4"
    solana-sdk = "1.17"
    log = "0.4"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Go">
    1. Create a new project:

    ```bash
    mkdir go-yellowstone-client
    cd go-yellowstone-client
    ```

    2. Initialize Go module:

    ```bash
    go mod init go-yellowstone-client
    ```

    3. Create project structure:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p cmd/client
    touch cmd/client/main.go
    ```

    4. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    go get github.com/mr-tron/base58@v1.2.0
    go get github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc/examples/golang@latest
    go get google.golang.org/grpc@v1.67.1
    ```

    5. Your `go.mod` should look similar to this:

    ```go
    module go-yellowstone-client

    go 1.21

    require (
        github.com/mr-tron/base58 v1.2.0
        github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc/examples/golang v0.0.0-20250206164228-b9f96ae944bb
        google.golang.org/grpc v1.67.1
    )

    require (
        golang.org/x/net v0.28.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/sys v0.24.0 // indirect
        golang.org/x/text v0.17.0 // indirect
        google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/rpc v0.0.0-20240814211410-ddb44dafa142 // indirect
        google.golang.org/protobuf v1.35.1 // indirect
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  These setups provide the foundation for the examples in the following sections. Each subsequent guide will build upon this basic setup to demonstrate specific monitoring capabilities.

## Available Subscriptions

The Yellowstone gRPC interface allows you to subscribe to various types of data:

### 1. Account Updates

<Card title="Account Updates" icon="user">
  Subscribe to changes in [account data](/grpc/account-monitoring), including:

  * Account balance changes
  * Data modifications
  * Ownership changes
  * Creation/deletion events
</Card>

### 2. Slot Updates

<Card title="Slot Updates" icon="clock">
  [Monitor slots](/grpc/slot-and-block-monitoring) to receive notifications about:

  * New slots
  * Confirmed slots
  * Finalized slots
  * Parent slot relationships
</Card>

### 3. Transaction Information

<Card title="Transaction Information" icon="exchange">
  [Stream transactions](/grpc/transaction-monitoring) to receive updates about:

  * Transaction signatures
  * Transaction status
  * Success/failure information
  * Account involvement
</Card>

### 4. Block Data

<Card title="Block Data" icon="cube">
  Access comprehensive [block information](/grpc/slot-and-block-monitoring):

</Card>

### 5. Entry Data

<Card title="Entry Data" icon="code">

  * Entry hashes
</Card>

### Commitment Levels

<Accordion title="Commitment Levels" defaultOpen={true}>
  Yellowstone gRPC supports three commitment levels:

  * <Tip>**PROCESSED**: Fastest, but may include unconfirmed data</Tip>
  * <Info>**CONFIRMED**: Balance between speed and finality</Info>
  * <Check>**FINALIZED**: Highest level of finality</Check>

  Choose the appropriate commitment level based on your application's requirements for data finality versus latency.
</Accordion>
