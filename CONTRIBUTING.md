# Contributing to Helius Docs

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository powers the Helius documentation site using Mintlify.

## Quick start

1. Install Mint CLI

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

2. Run the docs locally from the repo root (where `docs.json` is):

```bash
mint dev
```

3. Create a new branch and make your changes.

## What to edit

- Edit English source files under the repo root (e.g., `index.mdx`, `rpc/...`, `api-reference/...`).
- Do not edit files under `zh/`. They are autogenerated.
- If adding images, put them in `images/` and use descriptive alt text.
- Keep examples runnable and realistic. Avoid placeholder secrets.

## i18n workflow

- English content is the source of truth.
- The `zh/` folder is generated via our i18n pipeline. Do not open PRs modifying `zh/` directly.
- Linking: use language-agnostic relative links (e.g., `/rpc/overview`) where possible.

## Writing and style

- Follow the Mintlify technical writing rules in this repo.
- Use active voice and second person.
- Prefer short sentences and scannable lists.
- Ensure headings are descriptive and keyword-rich.
- Add `<Steps>`, `<Tabs>`, `<CodeGroup>`, `<Note/Tip/Warning/Check>` where applicable.

## Linting and formatting

- Keep Markdown and MDX clean and readable.
- Ensure code blocks include a language tag and, when relevant, filenames.
- No real secrets. Use environment variables or placeholders like `YOUR_API_KEY`.

## Analytics

- PostHog is configured in `docs.json`. The public API key is intentional and safe to commit.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] English content only (no `zh/` changes)
- [ ] Links verified
- [ ] Examples runnable and safe
- [ ] Alt text for images
- [ ] Titles and descriptions set in frontmatter where applicable

## Local build gotchas

- If `mint dev` fails, run `mint update` once and retry.
- Make sure you launch from the repository root where `docs.json` exists.

## Community guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive.
