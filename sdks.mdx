description: "Official Helius SDKs for Solana development in Node.js and Rust. Simplify blockchain integration with comprehensive APIs, enhanced transactions, and DAS support."

  At Helius, we've developed a [Node.js](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk) and a [Rust SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-rust-sdk) to make developing on Solana easier. The following page includes information on installing and using these SDKs. It also covers common error handling, where to find the latest documentation, and how to contribute to these SDKs.

We also outline a list of unofficial community SDKs made by our wonderful community. Note that those SDKs are not officially maintained by our team — only the Node.js and Rust SDKs are.

## Node.js SDK

Note the Node.js SDK has been rewritten as of version 2.0.0. This was done to use `@solana/kit` and remove the dependency on `@solana/web3.js` versions higher than 1.73.2. For those migrating to the latest version, please refer to our [migration guide](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk/blob/main/MIGRATION.md).

### Installation

The Helius Node.js SDK can be installed with any of the following package managers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install helius-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install helius-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add helius-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Quick Start

Below is a straightforward example of how to use the Node.js SDK to fetch a list of assets owned by a given address:

```typescript
import { createHelius } from "helius-sdk";

(async () => {
  const apiKey = ""; // From Helius dashboard
  const helius = createHelius({ apiKey });

  try {
    const assets = await helius.getAssetsByOwner({
      ownerAddress: "owner_address_goes_here",
      page: 1,
      limit: 50,
      sortBy: { sortBy: "created", sortDirection: "asc" },
    });

    console.log("Fetched assets:", assets);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
})();
```

### Documentation

The [examples directory](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk/tree/main/examples) is filled with in-depth code examples covering each method and basic usage, organized by namespace. For API reference documentation, refer to our [documentation](/api-reference) and the [official Solana documentation](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) for general Solana JSON RPC API help. For general help with Kit, please refer to [Kit's documentation](https://www.solanakit.com/).

## Rust SDK

### Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add dependency to Cargo.toml">
    To start using the Helius Rust SDK in your project, add it as a dependency via [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Open your project's `Cargo.toml` and add the following line under `[dependencies]`:

    ```toml
    helius = "x.y.z"
    ```

    where `x.y.z` is your desired version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alternative: Use cargo add command">
    Alternatively, use `cargo add helius` to add the dependency directly via the command line. This will automatically find the latest version compatible with your project and add it to your `Cargo.toml`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep your SDK updated">
    Remember to run `cargo update` regularly to fetch the latest version of the SDK.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Quick Start

Below is a straightforward example of using the [Enhanced Transactions API](/enhanced-transactions) to [parse a given transaction](/api-reference/enhanced-transactions/gettransactions):

```rust
use helius::error::Result;
use helius::types::*;
use helius::Helius;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let api_key: &str = "your_api_key";
    let cluster: Cluster = Cluster::MainnetBeta;

    let helius: Helius = Helius::new(api_key, cluster).unwrap();

    let request: ParseTransactionsRequest = ParseTransactionsRequest {
        transactions: vec![
            "2sShYqqcWAcJiGc3oK74iFsYKgLCNiY2DsivMbaJGQT8pRzR8z5iBcdmTMXRobH8cZNZgeV9Ur9VjvLsykfFE2Li".to_string(),
        ],
    };

    let response: Result<Vec<EnhancedTransaction>, HeliusError> = helius.parse_transactions(request).await;
    println!("Assets: {:?}", response);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Error Handling

<Callout type="warning">
  An error message will be thrown when the API returns a non-success (i.e., 4xx or 5xx status code).
</Callout>

For example, below is a 401 thrown for an incorrect getAsset call using the Node.js SDK:

```typescript
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32001,
    "message": "Authentication failed. Missing or invalid API key."
  },
  "id": "1"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

When working with the Helius SDK, you may encounter several error codes. Below is a table detailing some of the common error codes along with additional information to help you troubleshoot:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400: Bad Request">
    This occurs when a request has invalid parameters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="401: Unauthorized">
    This occurs when an invalid API key is provided or access is restricted due to RPC rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="429: Too Many Requests">
    This indicates that the user has exceeded the request limit in a given timeframe or is out of credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="5XX: Internal Server Error">
    This is a generic error message for server-side issues. Please contact Helius support for assistance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If you encounter any of these errors:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check error documentation">
    Refer to [`errors.rs`](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-rust-sdk/blob/dev/src/error.rs) for a list of all possible errors returned by the `Helius` client, if using the Rust SDK. For the Node.js SDK, refer to [Kit's errors](https://www.solanakit.com/docs/concepts/errors)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the documentation">
    Refer to the [Helius documentation](/) for further guidance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact support">
    Reach out to the Helius support team for more detailed assistance
