  title: Solana Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The Solana Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API provides comprehensive and standardized access to Solana blockchain NFTs and digital assets. 
    This powerful API set enables developers to retrieve detailed information about any digital asset on Solana, 
    including both traditional and compressed NFTs, with consistent data formatting regardless of token standard.

    Note, every successful DAS response includes a `last_indexed_slot` field indicating the most recent slot for which the DAS index is guaranteed to be
    complete. All on-chain data **up to and including** this slot has been indexed. Data beyond this slot may also have already been indexed,
    although it is not guaranteed.

        description: |
          Retrieve comprehensive data for any Solana NFT or digital asset by its unique identifier.
          This endpoint provides complete on-chain and off-chain metadata, ownership details, royalty information,
          collection data, and compression state for any Solana digital asset. The getAsset method supports all token standards 
          including compressed NFTs (cNFTs), programmable NFTs (pNFTs), and traditional SPL tokens.
          
          Use this endpoint to:
          - Fetch complete metadata for NFT marketplace listings
          - Retrieve asset ownership information for wallet integrations
          - Access royalty and creator data for royalty enforcement
          - Check compression status to identify cost-efficient compressed NFTs
          - View collection grouping for NFT collection analytics
