## What is Solana RPC?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are the gateway to interacting with the Solana blockchain. They allow applications to:

- Read blockchain data like account balances and transaction history
- Submit new transactions to the network
- Subscribe to events and updates
- Query current network status and performance

Without RPC nodes, applications couldn't communicate with the Solana blockchain. These nodes maintain a full copy of the blockchain and expose standardized APIs that developers can use to build applications.
