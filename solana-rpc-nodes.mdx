## What is Solana RPC?

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are the gateway to interacting with the Solana blockchain. They allow applications to:

- Read blockchain data like account balances and transaction history
- Submit new transactions to the network
- Subscribe to events and updates
- Query current network status and performance

Without RPC nodes, applications couldn't communicate with the Solana blockchain. These nodes maintain a full copy of the blockchain and expose standardized APIs that developers can use to build applications.

## Types of Helius RPC Nodes

Helius offers two types of RPC node solutions to meet different needs:

### RPC Nodes

RPC nodes are our standard offering that provides high-performance, reliable access to the Solana blockchain at an affordable price point.

**Key benefits:**
- Cost-effective solution for most projects
- No setup or maintenance required
- Globally distributed for low-latency access
- Automatic routing to the nearest node
- Flexible pay-as-you-go pricing

### Dedicated Nodes

Dedicated nodes provide a private, exclusive environment optimized for gRPC streaming applications. These nodes are ideal for real-time data streaming, trading applications, and analytics that require ultra-low latency blockchain data feeds.

**Key benefits:**
- **Primary use case**: High-performance gRPC streaming via Yellowstone Geyser
- Exclusive access with no resource competition
- Ultra-low latency for real-time data feeds
- Enhanced security and isolation
- Predictable billing regardless of usage patterns

**Important**: Dedicated nodes should be combined with a shared plan for full functionality, as they do not support archival data. While `sendTransaction` and `getProgramAccounts` are supported, they are not optimized - `sendTransaction` will cause most transactions to not land, and heavy `getProgramAccounts` usage can impact node performance or cause node failure.
