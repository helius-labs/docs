Autoscaling allows your project to automatically purchase additional credits when you exhaust your monthly allocation, ensuring your applications continue running without interruption.

## How Autoscaling Works

When enabled, autoscaling automatically purchases additional credits in predefined increments when your usage reaches certain thresholds. This prevents service interruptions and maintains consistent performance for your applications.

## Setting Up Autoscaling

Autoscaling can be configured in the Project Settings on your dashboard:

1. Navigate to your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/) and select your project
2. Go to **Project Settings**
3. Find the Autoscaling section
4. Toggle autoscaling on
5. Save your settings

<Note>
Autoscaling is capped for Developer and Business plans to help manage costs and avoid unexpected charges. If you require unlimited autoscaling, consider upgrading to the **Professional** plan.
</Note>

## Payment Options for Additional Credits

### Card Payment Plans

For projects using credit/debit card payments, autoscaling is the recommended method for handling additional credit needs. When enabled, additional credits will be automatically charged to your payment method.

### Crypto Plans

If you're using cryptocurrency for payments, you'll need to purchase prepaid credits instead of using autoscaling:

1. Log into your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/)
2. Select **Buy More Credits**
3. Complete the purchase with your preferred crypto payment method

<Note>
Prepaid credits activate immediately and never expire—you keep them until they run out.

## Pricing for Additional Credits

Additional credit pricing depends on your current plan:

| Plan Type    | Price per Million Additional Credits |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Developer    | $5 per million                       |
| Business     | $5 per million                       |
| Professional | $4 per million                       |

If you're consistently going over your limit, consider upgrading your plan for better rates and unlimited autoscaling.

## Notifications and Tracking Credit Usage

Helius keeps you informed about your credit usage to help manage your spend:

* **Email Alerts**: You'll receive notifications via email when you're approaching your credit limits and when autoscaling occurs.
* **Dashboard Tracking**: Check your current credit usage and historical data directly from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/). Navigate to the **Usage** section to see detailed analytics.

## Autoscaling Limits and Enterprise Options

* **Developer and Business plans**: Autoscaling is available but has predefined caps to avoid unexpectedly large bills.
* **Professional plans**: Autoscaling is unlimited—ideal for rapidly scaling projects.
* **Enterprise plans**: For credit needs exceeding 1B/month, set up an Enterprise plan tailored to your requirements.
