  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'Authorize Automatic Withdrawals' mean?">
    When you authorize automatic withdrawals, you're giving the platform permission to pull the necessary amount of USDC (on Solana) directly from your wallet whenever a new billing period starts. This is often referred to as a "subscription" or "recurring payment," where you don't have to manually approve each individual charge.

    * **How It Works:**
      * At the beginning of each billing cycle, the system checks if you have enough USDC in your Solana wallet.
      * If sufficient funds are available, the required amount is automatically deducted to cover the plan's cost.
      * If you ever want to stop automatic charges, you can revoke this authorization via your wallet or billing settings.
    * **Why Authorize?**
      * It saves you from having to manually make a payment every month (or billing period).
      * It ensures your service continues without interruption, as the payment is handled automatically.
    * **Things to Keep in Mind:**
      * **Sufficient Funds:** Make sure your wallet has enough USDC ahead of each billing date.
      * **Revoking Authorization:** You can usually disable or revoke this automatic withdrawal at any time if you decide you'd rather pay manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I manually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing payments?">
    Manual payments are not supported. You must authorize USDC so it can be automatically deducted on billing days. However, you can **revoke** this authorization after each purchase by following these steps:

    1. Go to the [**Billing**](https://dashboard.helius.dev/billing) page and click **Manage Delegate Wallet** (this will redirect you to Loop).
    2. Select your plan (e.g., Developer).
    3. Click **Edit** in the Authorization section.
    4. Set the limit to **0** to revoke authorization.
