## What Are Credits?

Credits are the measurement unit for API usage on Helius. Each API call consumes a specific number of credits based on its complexity and resource requirements. Your subscription plan includes a set number of credits per month, and you can add more if needed.

## Credit Costs By Service

### Standard RPC Calls

Most standard RPC calls cost **1 credit** per call, with these exceptions:

- **Higher Complexity Calls**
  - [`getProgramAccounts`](/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts): 10 credits

- **Archival Calls** (10 credits each)
  - [`getTransaction`](/rpc/http/gettransaction)
  - [`getBlock`](/rpc/http/getblock)
  - [`getBlocks`](/rpc/http/getblocks)
