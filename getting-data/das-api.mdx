## What is DAS?

The Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API is an open-source specification and system that provides a unified interface for interacting with digital assets. The API supports fungible tokens, regular NFTs, and compressed NFTs. Some methods (e.g. "getAssetProof") are exclusively for compressed assets.

## Endpoints

Helius' API is fully compatible with the shared [OpenRPC specification](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api/blob/main/specification/metaplex-das-api.json). The API is exposed via our standard RPC endpoints:

</CardGroup>

## **DAS API**

## Fungible Token Extension

<Info>
  Helius has extended the DAS API to support **all tokens**, including plain SPL tokens (without metadata) and Token22 (plus their extensions). [Fungible token support](/getting-data/fungible-token-extension) is available through the [getAssetsByOwner](/das-api/getassetsbyowner) and [searchAssets](/das-api/searchassets) methods.
</Info>

## Inscriptions & SPL-20

<Tip>
  You can optionally display inscription and SPL-20 token data with the `showInscription` flag. You can learn more about inscriptions and SPL-20 [here](https://x.com/nick_pennie/status/1727877242045542858). Please note that this is an experimental feature.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  The Helius API does not verify SPL-20 tokens. Trade at your own risk. Please use the [validator tool](https://www.spl20.io/) or join the [Libreplex Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kTRGwcXx) for more information.
</Warning>

## Off-chain Indexing

<Accordion title="Off-chain Data Retrieval">
  Most NFT collections store additional metadata, such as attributes and image URLs, off-chain, typically on platforms like Arweave or IPFS. DAS enables you to retrieve this off-chain data alongside regular NFT data in a single API call by indexing all the off-chain information.

  <Note>
    Helius cannot detect off-chain data mutations. The off-chain data will only be updated once the NFT is seen by the system again (e.g. when the NFT is modified on-chain). If you need the off-chain data for a collection to be re-indexed, please reach out to Helius support.
