Program accounts contain the data for all instances of a Solana program. This guide shows you how to efficiently query and filter program accounts.

## Using getProgramAccounts

The primary method for fetching program accounts is `getProgramAccounts`:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY", {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: '1',
    method: 'getProgramAccounts',
    params: [
      'ProgramAddressHere',
      {
        encoding: 'jsonParsed',
        filters: [
          // Optional filters go here
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
```

## Advanced Filtering

Optimize your queries with filters to reduce response size and improve performance:

```typescript
// Example filtering by memcmp (memory comparison)
const filters = [
  {
    memcmp: {
      offset: 4, // bytes offset into the account data
      bytes: 'base58encodedBytes'
    }
  },
  {
    dataSize: 128 // exact data size in bytes
  }
];
```

## Filter Types

- `memcmp`: Filter accounts that match a specific pattern at a given offset
- `dataSize`: Filter accounts by their exact data size
- Multiple filters: All conditions must be satisfied (logical AND)

## Performance Tips

Program account queries can be expensive to execute. Follow these practices:

- Always use the most restrictive filters possible
- Consider paginating results for programs with many accounts
- Use WebSocket subscriptions for accounts you need to monitor continuously
- For tokens and NFTs, prefer the specialized DAS API endpoints over raw program account queries

## Rate Limiting Considerations

Heavy use of `getProgramAccounts` might result in rate limiting. For high-volume needs, consider:

- Using dedicated RPC nodes
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Implementing backoff strategies for retries
