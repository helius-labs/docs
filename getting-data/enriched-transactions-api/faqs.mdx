# Enhanced Transactions API FAQs

## General Questions

### What is the Enhanced Transactions API?

The Enhanced Transactions API provides parsed transaction data in a human-readable format. It allows you to parse individual or multiple transactions or fetch the complete historical transaction history for a specific address.

### What types of transactions can be parsed?

Currently, the Enhanced Transactions API only parses NFT, Jupiter, and SPL-related transactions. Do not rely on these parsers for DeFi or non-NFT, Jupiter, and SPL transactions.

### What's the difference between V1 and V2?

Enhanced Transaction API V1 won't be updated while we are working on V2. V2 will introduce additional parsing capabilities and improvements.

## Usage Questions

### How do I authenticate API requests?

All requests to the Enhanced Transactions API require your Helius API key, which should be provided as a query parameter (`?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`).

### Are there rate limits?

Yes, API usage is subject to Helius's standard rate limiting and pricing policies. Please refer to the [Pricing & Rate limits](/pricing-and-rate-limits) page for more information.

### How do I handle pagination for large transaction histories?

When fetching transaction history for an address, use the `before` parameter with the signature of the oldest transaction from your previous request to paginate through results.

### What commitment level should I use?

If not specified, the default commitment level is "finalized". You can optionally specify "processed" or "confirmed" depending on your use case.

## Technical Questions

### What information is included in the parsed transaction?

The parsed transaction includes:
- Human-readable description
- Transaction type
- Source program
- Fee information
- Signature
- Slot and timestamp
- Token transfers
- Native SOL transfers
- Account data changes
- Categorized events (NFT, swap, SOL transfers)

### How do I parse raw transactions?

You can send either transaction signatures or raw transactions to the `/v0/transactions` endpoint. For raw transactions, provide the base64-encoded transaction data.

### Can I filter transactions by type?

The API doesn't currently support filtering by transaction type in the request. You'll need to filter the results on your end after receiving them.

### How far back can I fetch transaction history?

The API allows you to fetch the complete transaction history for a Solana address, subject to the limitations of the underlying Solana blockchain data availability.
