---

<Info>
**Helius AirShip** is an open-source tool that makes token airdrops simple, affordable, and accessible. Whether you're distributing to Saga Chapter 2 holders, NFT/cNFT holders, SPL token holders, or using a CSV file, AirShip streamlines the process and dramatically reduces costs through ZK compression.
</Info>

## What is AirShip?

AirShip is a comprehensive airdrop solution that leverages ZK compression to make large-scale token distribution affordable on Solana. Instead of creating individual token accounts for each recipient (which costs ~0.002 SOL each), AirShip uses ZK compression to bundle recipient data into a single Merkle root, reducing costs by over 95%.

## Using the Web Version

<Info>
The web version is perfect for smaller airdrops and users who prefer a graphical interface.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AirShip">
    Visit the [AirShip website](https://airship.helius.dev) and click "Create New Airdrop."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Your Wallet">
    1. Enter your private key and RPC URL
    2. Use an RPC like `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

    <Warning>
    Use a temporary wallet created specifically for this airdrop task. The private key is only used for signing transactions and isn't stored or shared anywhere.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Recipients">
    Choose from several options:

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    Carefully review the airdrop summary:
    - Total recipients
    - Token amount per recipient
    - Estimated transaction fees
    - Total cost

    Once confirmed, AirShip will handle the batch sending and ZK proofs automatically.
