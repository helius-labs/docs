## What is AirShip?

AirShip is Helius's open-source token airdrop tool that leverages ZK compression to make large-scale token distribution affordable on Solana. By bundling recipient data into a single Merkle root instead of creating individual token accounts, AirShip reduces airdrop costs by over 95%.
