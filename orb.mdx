[Orb](https://orb.helius.dev/) is a full-featured Solana block explorer built and maintained by Helius. Orb officially [launched](https://www.helius.dev/blog/orb-block-explorer) on October 29th, 2025.

Orb is powered by Helius's [state-of-the-art archival system](https://www.helius.dev/blog/introducing-gettransactionsforaddress), which runs on bare-metal servers with petabyte-scale NVMe storage, replicated across multiple regions for redundancy.

Leveraging custom RPC methods such as [`getTransactionsForAddress`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/gettransactionsforaddress), Orb enables [faster historical queries](https://www.helius.dev/historical-data), and introduces a suite of advanced explorer features, including reverse search, slot and time-based filtering, transaction heatmaps, and more.
