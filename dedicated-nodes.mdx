---


Perfect for latency-sensitive applications such as data streaming via gRPC, dedicated nodes provide an exclusive environment with consistent performance and cost management. Choose a single node in a specific location to enhance server-to-server interactions or establish a node cluster for wide geographic distribution. **Dedicated nodes are best used with the Yellowstone Geyser (gRPC) Plugin for optimal streaming performance.**

## Primary Use Case

**Dedicated nodes are specifically designed for gRPC streaming applications** and should be combined with a shared plan for comprehensive Solana development needs:

- **gRPC Streaming**: Real-time blockchain data streaming with ultra-low latency
- **Data Monitoring**: Account, transaction, and block updates via Yellowstone Geyser
- **Trading Applications**: High-frequency data feeds for algorithmic trading
- **Analytics**: Real-time blockchain analytics and monitoring

## Node Options

- AMD EPYC 7443p
- AMD EPYC 7543p (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)
- AMD EPYC 9254 (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)

## Access Includes

- **gRPC streaming** via [Yellowstone Geyser Plugin](/grpc) (primary use case)
- Standard RPC and WebSocket methods (basic functionality only)
- Premium support
- Node clients — Agave (recommended) or Jito Labs

<Note>
  For trading teams and Telegram bots, we typically recommend purchasing
  Dedicated Nodes (lower latency) with the Yellowstone Geyser (gRPC) Plugin for
  streaming.
</Note>

## Limitations

<Note>
**Important**: Dedicated nodes have specific limitations and are not suitable as standalone solutions:

- **`sendTransaction` Poor Landing Rates**: While supported, not optimized - most transactions will not land
- **No Archival Data**: Historical data access is not available
- **`getProgramAccounts` Performance Risk**: While supported, heavy usage can impact node performance or cause node failure
- **No Platform Features**: APIs, webhooks, and staked connections require a shared plan

**Recommendation**: Use dedicated nodes for gRPC streaming in combination with a shared paid plan for comprehensive functionality.
