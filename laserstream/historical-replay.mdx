## Overview

One of LaserStream's most powerful features is **Historical Replay**, which allows you to replay data from a specific point in time. This capability ensures you never miss critical on-chain events, even if your application disconnects temporarily.

With Historical Replay, you can:

- **Backfill missing data** after a disconnection
- **Bootstrap new applications** with recent historical data
- **Analyze past events** for specific accounts or transactions
- **Test application behavior** with real historical data

## How Historical Replay Works

When you establish a LaserStream connection, you can optionally specify a starting slot using the `fromSlot` parameter. LaserStream will then:

1. Begin streaming data from the specified slot
2. Deliver all relevant events from that slot forward
3. Eventually catch up to real-time data
4. Continue streaming real-time events seamlessly

<Note>
**Automatic Reconnection**: The [LaserStream SDK (`helius-laserstream`)](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) automatically handles reconnections and replay for you. If your connection drops, the SDK will reconnect and resume from where it left off without requiring any additional code.
</Note>

## Using the `fromSlot` Parameter

The `fromSlot` parameter can be used with both gRPC and WebSocket connections.

### With gRPC

Add the `fromSlot` parameter to your `SubscribeRequest` object:

```typescript
const subscriptionRequest: SubscribeRequest = {
  transactions: {
    client: {
      accountInclude: ['TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA'],
      accountExclude: [],
      accountRequired: [],
      vote: false,
      failed: false
    }
  },
  commitment: CommitmentLevel.CONFIRMED,
  accounts: {},
  slots: {},
  blocks: {},
  blocksMeta: {},
  entry: {},
  accountsDataSlice: [],
  fromSlot: '224339000' // Specify the starting slot for historical replay
};
```

## Limitations

- **Replay Window**: Currently, you can replay data from up to 3000 slots in the past (approximately 20 minutes of blockchain activity).

## Best Practices

1. **Use Recent Slots**: When specifying a `fromSlot`, ensure it falls within the replay window (currently 3000 slots or about 20 minutes).
2. **Handle High Volumes**: During catch-up, you may receive data at a faster rate than during real-time streaming.
3. **Set Appropriate Filters**: To minimize the amount of data during replay, use specific filters.
4. **Monitor Reconnections**: The SDK handles reconnections automatically, but it's good practice to log when they occur.

## Simplified Example

```typescript
import { subscribe, CommitmentLevel, LaserstreamConfig, SubscribeRequest } from 'helius-laserstream';

async function main() {
  const subscriptionRequest: SubscribeRequest = {
    transactions: {
      client: {
        accountInclude: ['TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA'],
        vote: false,
        failed: false
      }
    },
    commitment: CommitmentLevel.CONFIRMED,
    accounts: {},
    slots: {},
    blocks: {},
    blocksMeta: {},
    entry: {},
    accountsDataSlice: [],
    // Optional: specify a starting slot for replay
    fromSlot: '224339000'
  };

  const config: LaserstreamConfig = {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Replace with your key
    endpoint: 'https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com', // Choose your closest region
  };

  // The subscribe function handles connection, reconnection, and replay automatically
  await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, async (data) => {
    // Process your data
    console.log(data);
  }, async (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

The [LaserStream SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/laserstream-sdk) will transparently handle:
- Initial connection and data streaming
- Automatic reconnection if the connection drops
- Resuming from where it left off after a reconnection
- Buffering and delivering data in the correct order
