## Overview

Both LaserStream and Dedicated Nodes provide gRPC streaming capabilities, but they serve different use cases. This guide helps you choose the right solution based on your specific requirements.

## Quick Recommendation

**LaserStream is the recommended choice for virtually all streaming use cases** due to its superior performance, enhanced reliability, managed infrastructure, and advanced features like historical replay and auto-reconnection. Dedicated nodes are only beneficial when you need isolated credits and rate limits.

## Detailed Comparison

| Feature | LaserStream (Pro Plan) | Dedicated Nodes |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Performance** | ✅ **Superior streaming performance** | ⚠️ **Can fail under high load** |
| **Reliability** | ✅ **Multi-node redundancy** | ❌ **Single point of failure** |
| **Historical Replay** | ✅ **Up to 3000 slots** (~20 minutes) | ❌ **Not available** |
| **Auto-Reconnection** | ✅ **Built-in with SDK** | ❌ **Manual implementation required** |
| **Rate Limits** | ⚠️ **Shared rate limits** | ✅ **Isolated rate limits** |
| **Credit Isolation** | ⚠️ **Shared credits** | ✅ **Dedicated credit pool** |
| **sendTransaction** | ✅ **Optimized landing rates** | ❌ **Poor landing rates** |
| **Archival Data Access** | ✅ **Available via shared plan** | ❌ **Not available** |
| **Platform Features** | ✅ **APIs, webhooks included** | ❌ **Requires separate shared plan** |
| **Geographic Distribution** | ✅ **Multiple regions worldwide** | ⚠️ **Single location** |

## When to Choose LaserStream (Pro Plan)

**LaserStream is the best choice for virtually all streaming applications:**

- **High-Performance Trading**: Real-time data feeds with superior performance and reliability
- **Production Applications**: Mission-critical systems that need guaranteed uptime
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Account monitoring, balance updates, transaction history
- **DeFi Analytics**: Protocol monitoring, yield farming data, liquidity tracking  
- **NFT Applications**: Collection monitoring, marketplace data, trait analysis
- **Enterprise Solutions**: Professional applications requiring managed infrastructure
- **Development & Testing**: Rapid prototyping and development without infrastructure setup

**Key Advantages:**
- **Superior Performance**: Optimized infrastructure delivers better streaming performance
- **Maximum Reliability**: Multi-node redundancy eliminates single points of failure
- **Zero Downtime**: No risk of node failure under high load
- **Instant Multi-Region Access**: Connect to the closest region worldwide for optimal performance
- **Historical Replay**: Never miss data even after disconnections
- **Enhanced SDK**: Professional-grade connection management and error handling

## When to Choose Dedicated Nodes

**Dedicated Nodes have very limited use cases and are only suitable for:**

- **Credit Pool Isolation**: When you need completely separate credit usage tracking
- **Rate Limit Isolation**: When you need your own isolated rate limit pools

**Important Limitations:**
- **Performance Risk**: Nodes can fail or become unresponsive under high load
- **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy - if the node goes down, you will experience increased latency
- **Cost Considerations**: Higher base cost with different pricing model - evaluate total cost for your usage
- **Limited Features**: Requires separate shared plan for full platform functionality

## Cost Considerations

### LaserStream
- **Professional Plan**: $999/month base cost
- **Data Usage**: 3 credits per 0.1MB of data
- **Transparent Pricing**: Pay only for the data you actually consume

### Dedicated Nodes
- **Node Cost**: $2,300+/month depending on specifications
- **Shared Plan Required**: Additional cost for full platform functionality

## Technical Requirements

### LaserStream
```typescript
// Simple integration with enhanced features
import { subscribe, LaserstreamConfig } from 'helius-laserstream';

const config: LaserstreamConfig = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  endpoint: 'https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com'
};

// Automatic reconnection and historical replay
await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, handleData, handleError);
```

### Dedicated Nodes
```typescript
// Manual connection management required
import { Client } from '@yellowstone-grpc/client';

const client = new Client(endpoint, undefined, {
  'grpc.keepalive_time_ms': 30000,
  // Custom connection settings...
});

// Manual reconnection logic needed
client.on('error', (error) => {
  // Implement your own reconnection strategy
});
```

## Migration Path

**Moving from Dedicated Nodes**: LaserStream is designed as a drop-in replacement. Simply change your endpoint and API key to migrate.

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Do you need the best streaming performance?** → **LaserStream**
2. **Do you want guaranteed uptime and reliability?** → **LaserStream**  
3. **Do you want to focus on your application, not infrastructure management?** → **LaserStream**
4. **Do you need historical replay?** → **LaserStream**
5. **Do you specifically need isolated credit pools and rate limits?** → Consider Dedicated Nodes (but weigh the significant downsides)
