## What are Enhanced Websockets?

Helius provides Enhanced WebSockets in addition to Solana's [standard WebSocket methods](/rpc/websocket), which offer faster response times than Standard WSS. 

Today, Enhanced WebSockets are now [powered by the same infrastructure that powers LaserStream](https://www.helius.dev/blog/introducing-next-generation-enhanced-websockets), our next-gen gRPC streaming service built for speed, simplicity, and fault-tolerance.

Enhanced WebSockets support two subscription methods: 

* [`transactionSubscribe`](/enhanced-websockets/transaction-subscribe)
* [`accountSubscribe`](/enhanced-websockets/account-subscribe)

### On what plans are Enhanced WebSockets available?

Enhanced WebSockets are available on Business and Professional [plans](/billing/plans). 

### Enhanced WebSocket Metering

Users who upgrade to Business and Professional plans after **October 16, 2025** are metered at **3 credits per 0.1 MB** of streamed data. Users on these plans before this date remain unmetered. 

Note: this is separate from **Yellowstone gRPC** functionality available through [**LaserStream**](/laserstream/) or [**Dedicated Nodes**](/dedicated-nodes/).

<Tip>
For high-volume data streaming on Professional plans, [**Data Add-Ons**](/billing/plans#data-add-ons) provide monthly data allowances (5TB-100TB) at predictable costs, and apply to both LaserStream and Enhanced WebSockets usage.

## Enhanced WebSockets Endpoints

Enhanced WebSockets are currently available on `mainnet` and `devnet` with the following URLs:

**Mainnet:** `wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

**Devnet:** `wss://atlas-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Warning>
Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; to keep the WebSocket connection alive, it is highly recommended that health checks be implemented and that pings be sent every minute.
