## What are Enhanced Websockets?

Helius provides Enhanced WebSockets in addition to Solana's standard WebSocket methods. These enhanced WebSockets offer faster response times than traditional WebSockets. We support two subscription methods: `transactionSubscribe` and `accountSubscribe`.

<Info>
Enhanced WebSockets are available on **Business and Professional plans**. Users who upgrade to these plans after **October 6, 2025** are metered at **3 credits per 0.1 MB** of streamed data. Users on these plans before this date remain unmetered. This is separate from **Yellowstone gRPC** functionality available through [**LaserStream**](/laserstream/) or [**Dedicated Nodes**](/dedicated-nodes/).
</Info>

<Tip>
For high-volume data streaming on Professional plans, [**Data Add-Ons**](/billing/plans-and-rate-limits#data-add-ons) provide included monthly data allowances (50TB-250TB) with reduced overage rates. Data Add-Ons apply to both LaserStream and Enhanced WebSockets usage.
</Tip>

## Subscription Endpoints

Geyser-enhanced WebSockets are currently available on `mainnet` and `devnet` with the following URLs

**Mainnet:** `wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

**Devnet:** `wss://atlas-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Warning>
Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; to keep the WebSocket connection alive, it is highly recommended that health checks be implemented and that pings be sent every minute.
