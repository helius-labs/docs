# How to Use `getBlock` to Retrieve Block Details

The `getBlock` RPC method allows you to retrieve detailed information about a confirmed block in the Solana ledger. This is essential for block explorers, transaction history analysis, and understanding the state of the chain at a specific point in time.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Inspecting Block Contents:** View all transactions included in a specific block.
*   **Retrieving Block Hashes:** Get the blockhash for a given slot, its parent's blockhash, and its parent slot.
*   **Checking Block Height and Time:** Find out a block's height (its sequence number) and its estimated production time.
*   **Analyzing Transaction Details:** With appropriate parameters, you can get full transaction data, including metadata like fees, status, pre/post balances, and inner instructions.
*   **Fetching Rewards:** Optionally include reward information for the block.

## Example: Fetching Block Information

Let's try to fetch information for an illustrative slot number on Devnet. 
**Important:** Slot numbers are processed rapidly. The slot number used below (`250000000`) is a placeholder. You should replace it with a recent, confirmed slot that you know exists on your target network (e.g., Devnet or Mainnet) when you run the example. You can find recent slot numbers using a Solana block explorer.

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Helius API key in the examples below.

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
# Replace 250000000 with a valid, recent slot number on Devnet/Mainnet
curl https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getBlock",
  "params": [
    250000000, 
    {
      "encoding": "jsonParsed",
      "transactionDetails": "full",
      "rewards": true,
      "maxSupportedTransactionVersion": 0
    }
  ]
}'
```

```javascript web3.js
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getBlockDetails() {
  const rpcUrl = 'https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace YOUR_API_KEY
  const connection = new Connection(rpcUrl, 'confirmed');
  
  // Replace with a valid, recent slot number on your target network
  const slotToQuery = 250000000; 

  try {
    const block = await connection.getBlock(slotToQuery, {
      encoding: "jsonParsed",
      transactionDetails: "full",
      rewards: true,
      maxSupportedTransactionVersion: 0 
    });

    if (block) {
      console.log('Block Details:');
      console.log(`   Slot: ${slotToQuery}`);
      console.log(`   Blockhash: ${block.blockhash}`);
      console.log(`   Previous Blockhash: ${block.previousBlockhash}`);
      console.log(`   Parent Slot: ${block.parentSlot}`);
      console.log(`   Block Height: ${block.blockHeight !== null ? block.blockHeight : 'N/A'}`);
      console.log(`   Block Time: ${block.blockTime ? new Date(block.blockTime * 1000).toISOString() : 'N/A'}`);
      console.log(`   Transactions Count: ${block.transactions.length}`);
      // console.log('   Transactions:', JSON.stringify(block.transactions, null, 2)); // Full transaction details
      // console.log('   Rewards:', JSON.stringify(block.rewards, null, 2)); // Reward details
    } else {
      console.log(`Block at slot ${slotToQuery} not found or not confirmed.`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching block ${slotToQuery}:`, error);
  }
}

getBlockDetails();
```

## Parameters

1.  `slot` (number, required): The slot number of the block to query (u64).

2.  `config` (object, optional): A configuration object with the following fields:
    *   `commitment` (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/commitment) to use. `processed` is not supported for this method. Defaults to `finalized`.
    *   `encoding` (string, optional): The encoding for transaction data. Defaults to `json` if `transactionDetails` is `full` or `accounts`, otherwise `base64`.
        *   `json`: Returns transactions and accounts data in JSON format (deprecated in favor of `jsonParsed`).
        *   `jsonParsed`: Returns transactions and accounts data as parsed JSON. This is recommended as it includes all transaction account keys (including those from Address Lookup Tables).
        *   `base58` (slow)
        *   `base64`
        *   `base64+zstd`
    *   `transactionDetails` (string, optional): Specifies the level of transaction detail to return. Defaults to `full`.
        *   `full`: Returns full transaction details, including transaction metadata.
        *   `accounts`: Returns a list of accounts detailed in each transaction, but not the full transaction data or metadata.
        *   `signatures`: Returns only the transaction signatures.
        *   `none`: Returns no transaction details.
    *   `rewards` (boolean, optional): Whether to include the rewards array in the response. Defaults to `false`.
    *   `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` (number, optional): The maximum transaction version to return. If the block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error is returned. If omitted, only legacy transactions are returned, and a block with any versioned transaction will cause an error. Set to `0` to include versioned transactions that use Address Lookup Tables.

## Response

If the specified block is confirmed and found, the `result` field will be an object containing information about the block. If the block is not found or not confirmed, `result` will be `null`.

Key fields in the block object include:

*   `blockhash` (string): The base-58 encoded blockhash for this block.
*   `previousBlockhash` (string): The base-58 encoded blockhash of the previous block. If the parent is not available (due to ledger cleanup), this might be the system program ID.
*   `parentSlot` (number): The slot number of the parent block.
*   `transactions` (array): An array of transaction objects included in the block. The structure of these objects depends on the `encoding` and `transactionDetails` parameters.
    *   Each transaction object typically contains `meta` (metadata like fee, status, logs, pre/post balances) and `transaction` (the actual transaction data, including message and signatures).
*   `rewards` (array, optional): An array of reward objects, present if `rewards: true` was specified. Each object details the `pubkey`, `lamports`, `postBalance`, `rewardType`, and potentially `commission`.
*   `blockTime` (number | null): The estimated production time of the block as a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch), or `null` if not available.
*   `blockHeight` (number | null): The height of this block (number of blocks before it in the chain originating from slot 0), or `null` if not available.

Refer to the official Solana RPC documentation for the complete and detailed structure of the transaction and meta objects within the response.
