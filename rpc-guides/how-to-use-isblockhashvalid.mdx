# How to Use `isBlockhashValid`

The `isBlockhashValid` RPC method checks whether a previously obtained blockhash is still considered valid by the network. Blockhashes have a limited lifetime (approximately 2 minutes, or 150 blocks), after which transactions referencing them will be rejected.

This method is crucial for applications that hold onto blockhashes for some time before submitting a transaction, to ensure the transaction doesn't fail due to an expired blockhash.

**Version Note:** This method is available in `solana-core` v1.9 and newer. For nodes running `solana-core` v1.8 or older, you should use `getFeeCalculatorForBlockhash` which, in addition to fee information, also implicitly indicates blockhash validity (it will error if the blockhash is too old).

## Common Use Cases

*   **Transaction Resubmission:** Before retrying a failed transaction, check if its original blockhash is still valid. If not, a new blockhash must be fetched.
*   **Delayed Transaction Signing:** If a transaction is prepared but signed and submitted later, verify the blockhash validity just before submission.
*   **Optimistic Transaction Processing:** Determine if a blockhash is likely to be accepted by the network if a transaction is sent immediately.

## Request Parameters

1.  **`blockhash`** (string, required): The blockhash to check, as a base-58 encoded string.
2.  **`options`** (object, optional): An optional configuration object that can include:
    *   **`commitment`** (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment) for the query (e.g., `"finalized"`, `"confirmed"`, `"processed"`). If omitted, the node's default commitment is used.
    *   **`minContextSlot`** (u64, optional): The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at. This ensures the RPC node does not respond with a status from a slot older than the `minContextSlot`.

## Response Structure

The `result` field in the JSON-RPC response is an `RpcResponse` object containing:

*   **`context`** (object): An object containing:
    *   **`slot`** (u64): The slot at which the RPC node evaluated the blockhash validity.
*   **`value`** (boolean): `true` if the blockhash is still valid, `false` otherwise.

**Example Response (Valid Blockhash):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "context": { "slot": 180000500 },
    "value": true
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Example Response (Invalid/Expired Blockhash):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "context": { "slot": 180000800 },
    "value": false
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Check validity of a blockhash (replace <YOUR_BLOCKHASH>):
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "isBlockhashValid",
    "params": [
      "<YOUR_BLOCKHASH>"
    ]
  }' \
  <YOUR_RPC_URL>

# Check with commitment and minContextSlot (replace <YOUR_BLOCKHASH>):
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "isBlockhashValid",
    "params": [
      "<YOUR_BLOCKHASH>",
      {
        "commitment": "confirmed",
        "minContextSlot": 170000000
      }
    ]
  }' \
  <YOUR_RPC_URL>
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function checkBlockhash(blockhashToCheck) {
  // Replace with your RPC endpoint
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');

  try {
    console.log(`Checking validity of blockhash: ${blockhashToCheck}`);
    const result = await connection.isBlockhashValid(blockhashToCheck);
    
    console.log(`  Blockhash is valid: ${result.value}`);
    console.log(`  Checked at slot: ${result.context.slot}`);

    // Example with options
    // const resultWithOptions = await connection.isBlockhashValid(
    //   blockhashToCheck,
    //   { commitment: 'confirmed', minContextSlot: result.context.slot - 100 }
    // );
    // console.log(`\nWith options - Valid: ${resultWithOptions.value}, Slot: ${resultWithOptions.context.slot}`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error checking blockhash ${blockhashToCheck}:`, error);
  }
}

// Example usage: First, get a recent blockhash
async function getRecentBlockhashAndCheck() {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const { blockhash } = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
    await checkBlockhash(blockhash); 
    
    // Example with a known old/invalid blockhash (will likely be false)
    // This blockhash is just an example and will be invalid.
    const oldBlockhash = 'J7rBdM6AecPDEZp8aPq5iPSNKVkU5Q76F3oAV4eW5wsW'; 
    // await checkBlockhash(oldBlockhash);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in example execution:', error);
  }
}

getRecentBlockhashAndCheck();
```

## Important Considerations

*   **Blockhashes Expire:** Blockhashes are only valid for a limited time (around 150 slots, or roughly 1-2 minutes). Always fetch a fresh blockhash if you are unsure or if significant time has passed.
*   **`minContextSlot` Usage:** Use `minContextSlot` to protect against querying a stale RPC node that might give an outdated "valid" response for a blockhash that is actually too old from the perspective of the rest of the cluster.
*   **Alternative for Older Nodes:** For nodes running Solana versions prior to 1.9, use `getFeeCalculatorForBlockhash("<YOUR_BLOCKHASH>")`. If this method returns successfully, the blockhash is valid. If it errors (typically because the blockhash is not found or too old), then the blockhash is invalid.
*   **Network Confirmation:** Even if `isBlockhashValid` returns `true`, a transaction is only finalized once it reaches the desired commitment level on the network after submission.

This guide provides the necessary details to use the `isBlockhashValid` RPC method effectively when building Solana applications.
