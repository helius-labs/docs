# How to Use `getAccountInfo` to Fetch Account Details

The `getAccountInfo` RPC method is a fundamental tool for querying the Solana blockchain. It allows you to retrieve all stored information associated with a specific account public key. This includes the account's lamport balance, the program that owns it, whether it's executable, and its stored data.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Checking SOL Balance:** Determine the native SOL balance of any account.
*   **Verifying Account Existence:** Check if an account with a given public key has been initialized (i.e., has lamports or data).
*   **Inspecting Program Accounts:** Retrieve the data stored within an account owned by a program, which is crucial for understanding a program's state.
*   **Identifying Account Owner:** Find out which program is the owner of an account. This helps determine how the account's data should be interpreted or if it's a system-owned account.
*   **Checking if an Account is Executable:** Identify if an account contains a deployed program.

## Example: Fetching Account Information

Let's fetch information for the Serum Program V3 ID (`9xQeWvG816bUx9EPjHmaT23yvVM2ZWbrrpZb9PusVFin`) on mainnet.

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Helius API key in the examples below.

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getAccountInfo",
  "params": [
    "9xQeWvG816bUx9EPjHmaT23yvVM2ZWbrrpZb9PusVFin",
    {
      "encoding": "jsonParsed"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```javascript web3.js
const { Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getAccountDetails() {
  const rpcUrl = 'https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace YOUR_API_KEY
  const connection = new Connection(rpcUrl, 'confirmed');
  const accountPubKey = new PublicKey('9xQeWvG816bUx9EPjHmaT23yvVM2ZWbrrpZb9PusVFin');

  try {
    const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(accountPubKey);

    if (accountInfo === null) {
      console.log('Account not found.');
      return;
    }

    console.log('Account Info:');
    console.log(`   Lamports: ${accountInfo.lamports}`);
    console.log(`   Owner: ${accountInfo.owner.toBase58()}`);
    console.log(`   Executable: ${accountInfo.executable}`);
    console.log(`   Rent Epoch: ${accountInfo.rentEpoch}`);
    // Data is a Buffer, you might need to deserialize it based on the account type
    // console.log(`   Data: ${accountInfo.data.toString()}`); 
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching account info:', error);
  }
}

getAccountDetails();
```

## Parameters

1.  `publicKey` (string, required): The base-58 encoded public key of the account to query.

2.  `config` (object, optional): A configuration object with the following fields:
    *   `commitment` (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/commitment) to use for the query. Defaults to `finalized`.
        *   `finalized`: The node will query the most recent block confirmed by the supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout.
        *   `confirmed`: The node will query the most recent block that has been voted on by a supermajority of the cluster.
        *   `processed`: The node will query its most recent block. Note that the block may not be complete.
    *   `encoding` (string, optional): The encoding for account data. Defaults to `base64`.
        *   `base58` (slow)
        *   `base64`
        *   `base64+zstd` (if data is compressed)
        *   `jsonParsed`: If the account data is a known program state (e.g., token accounts, stake accounts), the node will attempt to parse it into a JSON structure. For generic program accounts, this usually falls back to binary (base64).
    *   `dataSlice` (object, optional): Limits the returned account data to a specific slice. Only available for `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd` encodings.
        *   `offset` (number): The number of bytes from the start of the account data to begin the slice.
        *   `length` (number): The number of bytes to return.
    *   `minContextSlot` (number, optional): The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

## Response

If the account is found, the `result` field will contain an object with two main properties:

*   `context` (object): Contains metadata about the request.
    *   `slot` (number): The slot at which the information was retrieved.
    *   `apiVersion` (string, optional): The RPC API version.

*   `value` (object | null): If the account does not exist, this will be `null`. Otherwise, it's an object containing:
    *   `lamports` (number): The number of lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports) owned by the account.
    *   `owner` (string): The base-58 encoded public key of the program that owns this account.
    *   `data` (array | object | string): The data stored in the account. The format depends on the `encoding` parameter used in the request.
        *   For `base64` (default), `base58`, `base64+zstd`: This is typically an array `[encoded_string, encoding_format]`, e.g., `["string_data", "base64"]`.
        *   For `jsonParsed`: This can be a JSON object if the data is parsable by the RPC node (e.g., for SPL Token accounts). Otherwise, it may default to `["", "base64"]` or similar if the data isn't recognized as a standard layout.
    *   `executable` (boolean): `true` if the account contains a program, `false` otherwise.
    *   `rentEpoch` (number): The next epoch at which this account will owe rent.
    *   `space` (number, optional): The length of the data in bytes. (Note: The official Solana docs list `space`, while some RPC providers might include it. It represents the total space allocated for the account's data).

If the account is not found, the `value` field in the result will be `null`.
