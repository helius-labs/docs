# How to Use `getRecentPerformanceSamples`

The `getRecentPerformanceSamples` RPC method provides a snapshot of the Solana network's recent performance. It returns a list of samples, taken approximately every 60 seconds, detailing the number of transactions and slots processed within those periods. This data is invaluable for monitoring network throughput and health.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Network Health Monitoring:** Track transaction processing rates and slot production to assess overall network health and identify potential congestion or slowdowns.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Analyze historical performance data to understand network behavior under different conditions.
*   **Dashboarding:** Display key performance indicators (KPIs) like transactions per second (TPS) and slots per minute on monitoring dashboards.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Observe trends in network load to inform scaling decisions for applications or infrastructure.

## Request Parameters

1.  **`limit`** (`usize`, optional):
    *   The number of most recent performance samples to return.
    *   Maximum value: `720` (representing approximately 12 hours of data, as samples are taken every 60 seconds).
    *   If omitted, the RPC node will return a default number of samples (the exact default can vary by RPC provider).

## Response Structure

The `result` field of the JSON-RPC response is an array of performance sample objects, returned in reverse chronological order (most recent sample first). Each object has the following structure:

*   **`slot`** (`u64`): The slot number in which this performance sample was recorded.
*   **`numTransactions`** (`u64`): The total number of transactions (including vote and non-vote transactions) processed during the `samplePeriodSecs` leading up to this `slot`.
*   **`numSlots`** (`u64`): The number of slots that were processed during the `samplePeriodSecs` leading up to this `slot`.
*   **`samplePeriodSecs`** (`u16`): The duration, in seconds, over which this sample was taken (typically `60`).
*   **`numNonVoteTransactions`** (`u64`): The number of transactions that were not consensus vote transactions, processed during the `samplePeriodSecs`.

## Examples

### 1. Get the Last 5 Performance Samples

This example requests the five most recent performance samples from the network.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getRecentPerformanceSamples",
    "params": [5]
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
// Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function fetchRecentPerformance() {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const samples = await connection.getRecentPerformanceSamples(5);
    if (samples && samples.length > 0) {
      console.log(`Fetched ${samples.length} performance samples:`);
      samples.forEach((sample, index) => {
        console.log(`--- Sample ${index + 1} ---`);
        console.log(`  Slot: ${sample.slot}`);
        console.log(`  Number of Slots in Period: ${sample.numSlots}`);
        console.log(`  Total Transactions: ${sample.numTransactions}`);
        console.log(`  Non-Vote Transactions: ${sample.numNonVoteTransactions}`);
        console.log(`  Sample Period (seconds): ${sample.samplePeriodSecs}`);
        const tps = sample.numTransactions / sample.samplePeriodSecs;
        const nonVoteTps = sample.numNonVoteTransactions / sample.samplePeriodSecs;
        console.log(`  Average TPS (Total): ${tps.toFixed(2)}`);
        console.log(`  Average TPS (Non-Vote): ${nonVoteTps.toFixed(2)}`);
      });
    } else {
      console.log('No performance samples returned.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching recent performance samples:', error);
  }
}

fetchRecentPerformance();
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Get Default Number of Performance Samples

This example omits the `limit` parameter, requesting the RPC node's default number of samples.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getRecentPerformanceSamples"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
// Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function fetchDefaultPerformanceSamples() {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const samples = await connection.getRecentPerformanceSamples(); // No limit parameter
    if (samples && samples.length > 0) {
      console.log(`Fetched ${samples.length} (default) performance samples:`);
      // Process or log samples as needed - e.g., the first one
      const sample = samples[0];
      console.log(`--- Most Recent Sample ---`);
      console.log(`  Slot: ${sample.slot}`);
      console.log(`  Total Transactions: ${sample.numTransactions}`);
      console.log(`  Non-Vote Transactions: ${sample.numNonVoteTransactions}`);
      console.log(`  Slots in Period: ${sample.numSlots}`);
      console.log(`  Sample Period (seconds): ${sample.samplePeriodSecs}`);
    } else {
      console.log('No performance samples returned.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching default performance samples:', error);
  }
}

fetchDefaultPerformanceSamples();
```
</CodeGroup>

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Sampling Interval:** Samples are typically taken every 60 seconds, but this is an approximation. The `samplePeriodSecs` field in the response indicates the actual duration for each sample.
*   **Historical Data Limit:** The maximum `limit` of 720 samples provides a window of approximately 12 hours of historical data. For longer-term performance analysis, external data logging and aggregation are necessary.
*   **Vote vs. Non-Vote Transactions:** `numTransactions` includes all transactions, while `numNonVoteTransactions` specifically counts those that are not part of the consensus voting process. The latter is often a better indicator of user-driven network activity.
*   **Node Variability:** The exact data might vary slightly between different RPC nodes depending on their synchronization state and local view of the network when a sample is taken.

By utilizing `getRecentPerformanceSamples`, developers and network observers can gain valuable insights into the operational status and throughput of the Solana network.
