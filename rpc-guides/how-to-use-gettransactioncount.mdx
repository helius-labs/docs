# How to Use `getTransactionCount`

The `getTransactionCount` RPC method returns the current total number of transactions processed by the Solana ledger since genesis, at a specified commitment level.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Network Statistics:** Displaying the overall transaction volume on the network as a general health or activity indicator.
*   **Growth Tracking:** Monitoring the increase in transaction count over time to observe network adoption and usage trends.
*   **Dashboard Metrics:** Providing a high-level overview of blockchain activity.

## Request Parameters

This method has one optional parameter:

1.  **`options`** (object, optional): An optional configuration object that can include:
    *   **`commitment`** (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment) for the query (e.g., `"finalized"`, `"confirmed"`, `"processed"`). If not provided, the node's default commitment is used.
    *   **`minContextSlot`** (u64, optional): The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

## Response Structure

The `result` field in the JSON-RPC response is a single `u64` number representing the total transaction count from the ledger up to the slot determined by the commitment level.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": 398146706879,
  "id": 1
}
```

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Basic Request (uses default commitment of the RPC node):
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getTransactionCount"
  }' \
  <YOUR_RPC_URL>

# Request with a specific commitment level:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getTransactionCount",
    "params": [
      {
        "commitment": "confirmed"
      }
    ]
  }' \
  <YOUR_RPC_URL>
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getCurrentTransactionCount() {
  // Replace with your RPC endpoint
  const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');

  try {
    const transactionCount = await connection.getTransactionCount();
    console.log(`Current ledger transaction count: ${transactionCount}`);

    // Example with commitment
    const confirmedTransactionCount = await connection.getTransactionCount('confirmed');
    console.log(`Current ledger transaction count (confirmed): ${confirmedTransactionCount}`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching transaction count:', error);
  }
}

getCurrentTransactionCount();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Important Considerations

*   **Ledger-Wide Count:** This count represents all transactions processed on the ledger since its inception, not just for a specific account or block.
*   **Increasing Value:** The transaction count is a monotonically increasing value.
*   **Commitment Level:** The returned count depends on the chosen `commitment` level. A `processed` commitment will likely yield a higher, more up-to-the-second count than `finalized`, but `finalized` offers a guarantee against rollbacks.
*   **Not a TPS Metric:** While related to network activity, this single value doesn't directly translate to Transactions Per Second (TPS) without comparing counts over a defined time period.
