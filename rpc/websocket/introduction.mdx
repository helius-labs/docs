---

Helius' RPC Websocket interface provides a powerful way to establish persistent connections to the Solana network, enabling real-time updates through subscriptions rather than traditional polling with HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

After connecting to the Helius RPC PubSub websocket endpoint, you can:

- Submit multiple subscription requests that can be active simultaneously
- Receive notifications based on your specified commitment level (defaulting to `finalized` if unspecified)
- Monitor for changes to accounts, blocks, programs, and other on-chain data in real-time

## Connection Details

Helius provides the following websocket endpoints:
- Mainnet: `wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`
- Devnet: `wss://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Helius API key.

## Subscription Benefits

Using Helius websocket subscriptions offers several advantages over HTTP polling:

1. **Reduced Latency**: Receive updates as they happen
2. **Lower Resource Usage**: Eliminate constant polling requests
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Maintain a single persistent connection
4. **Real-time Applications**: Build responsive dApps that react immediately to blockchain state changes

## Basic Usage

To interact with the Helius Websocket API:

1. Establish a connection to the appropriate Helius websocket endpoint
2. Send a subscription request for your desired event type
3. Listen for incoming messages on the established connection
4. Process the notification data as needed in your application
5. Unsubscribe when the connection is no longer needed

## Common Subscription Types

Helius supports standard Solana websocket methods for different use cases, including:

- Account updates
- Program updates
- Signature confirmations
- Slot updates
- Block information
- Transaction events

Note that some unstable Solana websocket methods (like `blockSubscribe`, `slotsUpdatesSubscribe`, and `voteSubscribe`) may not be supported on shared nodes but could be enabled for dedicated Helius nodes.

Each subscription type serves different monitoring needs, allowing developers to create responsive and efficient blockchain applications.

## Enhanced Websockets (Beta)

Helius also offers an Enhanced Websockets feature in beta that provides additional functionality beyond standard Solana websockets. This service enables more advanced real-time data streaming capabilities.
