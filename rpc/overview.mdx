### Dedicated RPC Nodes (Limited Use Cases)

<Card title="Only for Unlimited Credits/Rate Limits" icon="server">
  **Consider only if you specifically need unlimited credits and rate limits**
  
  **When to Consider:**
  - Require unlimited credits
  - Require unlimited rate limits
  
  **Important Trade-offs:**
  - Performance risk: Can become slow under high load
  - Higher cost: $2,300+/month plus requires shared plan
  - Limited features: Missing advanced APIs
