Solana Devnet is a testing environment that replicates Solana Mainnet Beta for developers to test their applications without using real SOL. Devnet SOL is used for testing transactions, deploying programs, and experimenting with on-chain apps before going live on Solana Mainnet Beta.

## How to Get Devnet SOL from the CLI

### Prerequisites

To use the CLI method, ensure you have:

- **Solana CLI**: [install the Solana CLI tools](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#install-the-solana-cli)
- **Helius Devnet RPC Endpoint**: get your [Devnet RPC URL](https://dashboard.helius.dev/endpoints) from your dashboard

### Step 1: Check your default keypair

First, verify your current keypair and wallet address:

```bash
solana address
```

If you don't have a keypair, create one:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Step 2: Set your CLI config to use the Helius Devnet RPC endpoint

Configure your Solana CLI to use your Helius Devnet RPC URL:

```bash
solana config set --url https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<your-api-key>
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

### Step 3: Request a Devnet SOL airdrop

Request an airdrop of Devnet SOL to your wallet:

```bash
solana airdrop 0.5
```

### Step 4: Check your balance

Verify that the Devnet SOL was successfully added to your wallet:

```bash
solana balance
```

## How to Get Devnet SOL from the UI

### Step 1: Log in to your dashboard

Sign in to your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev).

### Step 2: Go to the Devnet Faucet page

In the sidebar navigation menu, click "Faucet" to access the [Devnet faucet](https://dashboard.helius.dev/faucet) page.

### Step 3: Enter your Solana address

Enter your Solana wallet address in the provided field. You can get your wallet address from your Solana CLI using `solana address` or copy it from your wallet application.

### Step 4: Request Devnet SOL

Click "Airdrop 1 SOL" to receive your Devnet tokens.

### Step 5: Verify the transaction

Once your request is processed, you'll see a confirmation message with the transaction signature. You can verify the transaction on a [Solana explorer](https://orb.helius.dev/) or check your wallet balance.

## Conclusion

Getting Devnet SOL is essential for testing your Solana applications safely before deploying to mainnet. You can obtain Devnet SOL through either the Solana CLI or the Solana Devnet faucet in your dashboard, with daily limits based on your account tier.
