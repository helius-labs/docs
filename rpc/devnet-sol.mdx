Solana devnet is a testing environment that replicates the mainnet for developers to test their applications without using real SOL. Devnet SOL is used for testing transactions, deploying programs, and experimenting with dApps before going live on mainnet.

## How to Get Devnet SOL from the CLI

### Prerequisites

Before requesting devnet SOL via CLI, ensure you have:

- **Solana CLI**: [Install the Solana CLI tools](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#install-the-solana-cli)
- **Helius Devnet RPC Endpoint**: Your Helius devnet RPC URL from your dashboard

### Step 1: Check your default keypair

First, verify your current keypair and wallet address:

```bash
solana address
```

If you don't have a keypair, create one:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Step 2: Set your CLI config to use the Helius Devnet RPC endpoint

Configure your Solana CLI to use your Helius devnet endpoint:

```bash
solana config set --url https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<your-api-key>
```

Verify your configuration:

```bash
solana config get
```

### Step 3: Request Devnet SOL Airdrop

Request an airdrop of devnet SOL to your wallet:

```bash
solana airdrop 0.5
```

### Step 4: Check your balance

Verify that the devnet SOL was successfully added to your wallet:

```bash
solana balance
```

## How to Get Devnet SOL from the UI

### Step 1: Log into your dashboard

Navigate to [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev) and sign in to your Helius account.

### Step 2: Go to the Devnet Faucet page

In your dashboard navigation, click on "Devnet Faucet" to access the [devnet faucet](https://dashboard.helius.dev/faucet) page.

### Step 3: Enter Your Solana Address

Enter your Solana wallet address in the provided field. You can get your wallet address from your Solana CLI using `solana address` or copy it from your wallet application.

### Step 4: Request Devnet SOL

Click "Airdrop 1 SOL" to receive your devnet tokens.
### Step 5: Verify the transaction

Once the request is processed, you'll see a confirmation message with the transaction signature. You can verify the transaction on a Solana explorer or check your wallet balance.

## Conclusion

Getting devnet SOL is essential for testing your Solana applications safely before deploying to mainnet. You can obtain devnet SOL through either the Solana CLI or the convenient Helius dashboard faucet, with daily limits based on your account tier.
