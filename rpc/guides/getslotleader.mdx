The [`getSlotLeader`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getslotleader) RPC method returns the public key of the validator that is the current leader for block production, based on the node's view at a specified commitment level. The leader is responsible for producing blocks for the current slot.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Identifying the Current Block Producer:** Find out which validator is currently scheduled to produce blocks.
*   **Network Monitoring:** Observe the rotation of slot leaders.
*   **Debugging Transaction Issues:** In some advanced scenarios, knowing the current slot leader might be relevant if transactions are being submitted directly to leaders (though this is not a common client-side practice).

## Request Parameters

This method takes an optional configuration object as its first parameter:

1.  **`options`** (`object`, optional): An optional configuration object with the following fields:
    *   **`commitment`** (`string`, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-commitment-levels) for the query. Supported values are `finalized`, `confirmed`, or `processed`. If omitted, the default commitment of the RPC node is used (usually `finalized`). The slot leader is determined based on the slot that matches this commitment level.
    *   **`minContextSlot`** (`number`, optional): The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at. This sets the minimum slot for the node's context.

## Response Structure

The `result` field of the JSON-RPC response is a single base-58 encoded string representing the public key (identity) of the current slot leader.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "ENvAW7JScgYq6o4zKZwewtkzzJgDzuJAFxYasvmEQdpS",
  "id": 1
}
```

## Examples

### 1. Get Current Slot Leader (Default Commitment)

This example fetches the current slot leader using the node's default commitment level (usually `finalized`).

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getSlotLeader"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
// Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getCurrentSlotLeader() {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const slotLeader = await connection.getSlotLeader();
    console.log('Current slot leader (default commitment):', slotLeader);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching current slot leader:', error);
  }
}

getCurrentSlotLeader();
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Get Current Slot Leader with `confirmed` Commitment

This example fetches the slot leader for the latest slot that has reached `confirmed` commitment.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getSlotLeader",
    "params": [
      {
        "commitment": "confirmed"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
// Replace <api-key> with your Helius API key
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getConfirmedSlotLeader() {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const slotLeader = await connection.getSlotLeader('confirmed');
    console.log('Current slot leader (confirmed commitment):', slotLeader);
    // Note: For @solana/web3.js v1.30.0 and later, you can pass commitment directly.
    // For older versions or more complex options, use an object:
    // const slotLeader = await connection.getSlotLeader({ commitment: 'confirmed' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching confirmed slot leader:', error);
  }
}

getConfirmedSlotLeader();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Developer Tips

*   **Dynamic Nature:** Slot leaders change frequently (every few slots, typically 4). The result of this call is a snapshot in time based on the node's current view and the chosen commitment.
*   **Commitment Level:** The commitment level affects which slot is considered "current" for determining the leader. Using `processed` will give you the leader of the very latest slot the node is aware of, which might change rapidly and may not yet be confirmed by the broader network.
*   **Leader Schedule:** The sequence of slot leaders is determined by a leader schedule, which is calculated at the beginning of each epoch. You can learn more about this in our guide on [Slots, Blocks, and Epochs](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-slots-blocks-and-epochs). For a more comprehensive view of upcoming leaders, use `getLeaderSchedule`.
*   **Node's Perspective:** The returned slot leader is based on the information available to the specific RPC node you are querying. Different nodes might have slightly different views due to network latency.

`getSlotLeader` provides a quick way to identify the validator currently responsible for producing blocks. For a broader view of the leader rotation, consider `getLeaderSchedule`.
