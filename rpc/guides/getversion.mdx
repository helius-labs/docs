The [`getVersion`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getversion) RPC method returns the current Solana software version running on the queried RPC node. This includes the `solana-core` version string and a `feature-set` identifier.

This method is useful for verifying the version of a node you are interacting with or for diagnostic purposes.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Node Version Verification:** Confirming the software version of an RPC node, which can be important for compatibility or to understand available features.
*   **Network Monitoring:** Tools might periodically check versions of various nodes to get a sense of software distribution across the network (though `getClusterNodes` provides a more comprehensive view for this).
*   **Troubleshooting:** Knowing the node version can be crucial when diagnosing issues or unexpected behavior.

## Request Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

## Response Structure

The `result` field of the JSON-RPC response will be an object containing:

*   **`solana-core`** (string): The version string of the Solana core software (e.g., "1.18.4").
*   **`feature-set`** (u32): A numerical identifier for the set of features activated on the node.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "solana-core": "1.18.4",
    "feature-set": 3595898949
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getVersion"
  }' \
  <YOUR_RPC_URL>
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getNodeVersion() {
  // Replace with your RPC endpoint
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');

  try {
    const versionInfo = await connection.getVersion();
    console.log('Node Version Information:');
    console.log(`  Solana Core: ${versionInfo['solana-core']}`);
    console.log(`  Feature Set: ${versionInfo['feature-set']}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching node version:', error);
  }
}

getNodeVersion();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Developer Tips

*   **Simplicity:** This is one of the simplest RPC calls, useful for a quick check of the node's software.
*   **Node Specific:** The version returned is specific to the RPC node you are querying. Different nodes in the cluster might be running slightly different versions, especially during upgrade periods.
