The [`getVoteAccounts`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getvoteaccounts) RPC method returns information about all voting accounts (validators) in the current bank. It distinguishes between `current` (active) and `delinquent` validators and provides details about their stake, voting activity, and identity.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Validator Monitoring:** Tracking the status, stake, and performance of validators on the network.
*   **Staking Dashboards:** Displaying information about available validators for users looking to delegate their SOL.
*   **Network Health Analysis:** Assessing the overall health and decentralization of the network by examining the distribution of stake and validator activity.
*   **Identifying Delinquent Validators:** Finding validators that are not actively participating in consensus.

## Request Parameters

This method accepts an optional configuration object with the following fields:

1.  **`commitment`** (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-commitment-levels) for the query (e.g., `"finalized"`, `"confirmed"`, `"processed"`). If omitted, the node's default commitment is used.
2.  **`votePubkey`** (string, optional): If provided, the results will be filtered to include only the specified validator vote account address (base-58 encoded).
3.  **`keepUnstakedDelinquents`** (boolean, optional): Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the `delinquent` list will include validators with no activated stake. Otherwise, they are filtered out.
4.  **`delinquentSlotDistance`** (u64, optional): Specifies how many slots a validator must be behind the tip of the ledger to be considered delinquent. If not specified, the node uses a default value.

## Response Structure

The `result` field in the JSON-RPC response is an object containing two arrays:

*   **`current`**: An array of objects, where each object represents an active voting account with the following fields:
    *   **`votePubkey`** (string): The vote account address (base-58 encoded).
    *   **`nodePubkey`** (string): The identity public key of the validator node (base-58 encoded).
    *   **`activatedStake`** (u64): The amount of stake, in lamports, delegated to this vote account and active in the current epoch.
    *   **`epochVoteAccount`** (boolean): `true` if the vote account has been active at least once during the current epoch.
    *   **`commission`** (number): The commission percentage (0-100) charged by the validator.
    *   **`lastVote`** (u64): The most recent slot number this validator voted on.
    *   **`rootSlot`** (u64): The last slot the node considered to be a root (a block that is fully confirmed and will not be rolled back).
    *   **`epochCredits`** (array): An array of arrays, where each inner array contains `[epoch, credits_earned_in_epoch, previous_total_credits]`.
*   **`delinquent`**: An array of objects, with the same structure as `current`, representing validators considered delinquent by the node.

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function fetchVoteAccounts() {
  // Replace with your RPC endpoint
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');

  try {
    // Get all vote accounts
    const voteAccounts = await connection.getVoteAccounts();
    console.log(`Found ${voteAccounts.current.length} current validators.`);
    console.log(`Found ${voteAccounts.delinquent.length} delinquent validators.`);

    if (voteAccounts.current.length > 0) {
      console.log("\nFirst current validator details:");
      console.log(`  Vote Pubkey: ${voteAccounts.current[0].votePubkey}`);
      console.log(`  Node Pubkey: ${voteAccounts.current[0].nodePubkey}`);
      console.log(`  Activated Stake: ${voteAccounts.current[0].activatedStake} lamports`);
      console.log(`  Commission: ${voteAccounts.current[0].commission}%`);
      console.log(`  Last Vote: ${voteAccounts.current[0].lastVote}`);
      // console.log(JSON.stringify(voteAccounts.current[0], null, 2)); // For full details
    }

    // Get a specific vote account (replace with an actual vote account public key)
    // const specificVotePubkey = 'SPECIFIC_VOTE_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY';
    // const specificValidator = await connection.getVoteAccounts('confirmed', specificVotePubkey);
    // console.log(`\nDetails for ${specificVotePubkey}:`, JSON.stringify(specificValidator, null, 2));

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching vote accounts:', error);
  }
}

fetchVoteAccounts();
```

## Developer Tips

*   **Large Response:** This method can return a large amount of data, especially on networks with many validators like Mainnet Beta. Be mindful of response size and processing time.
*   **Delinquency Definition:** The definition of "delinquent" can depend on the `delinquentSlotDistance` and the node's perspective. A validator might appear delinquent on one node but not another if their view of the ledger tip differs.
*   **Stake Activation:** `activatedStake` reflects stake that is active in the current epoch. Stake takes time to activate and deactivate.
*   **Epoch Credits:** `epochCredits` provides a history of a validator's performance in earning credits by voting.
