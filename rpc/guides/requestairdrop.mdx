The [`requestAirdrop`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/requestairdrop) RPC method allows you to request an airdrop of SOL (lamports) to a specified account. This method is **exclusively for non-mainnet environments** like Devnet and Testnet, where it serves as a faucet to provide developers with free SOL for testing their applications.

**Important: This method will not work on Mainnet Beta.**

## Common Use Cases

*   **Funding Test Wallets:** Obtaining SOL to pay for transaction fees and deploy programs on Devnet or Testnet.
*   **Automated Testing:** Scripts can use `requestAirdrop` to ensure test accounts have sufficient SOL before running test suites.
*   **Development & Experimentation:** Quickly acquiring SOL to interact with on-chain programs during development.

## Request Parameters

1.  **`pubkey`** (string, required): The public key of the account that will receive the airdropped lamports, provided as a base-58 encoded string.
2.  **`lamports`** (u64, required): The amount of lamports to request. (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports).
3.  **`options`** (object, optional): An optional configuration object that can include:
    *   **`commitment`** (string, optional): Specifies the [commitment level](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api#configuring-state-commitment) to wait for when confirming the airdrop transaction (e.g., `"finalized"`, `"confirmed"`, `"processed"`). If omitted, the node's default commitment for airdrops is used.

## Response Structure

The `result` field in the JSON-RPC response is a single string representing the transaction signature of the airdrop, base-58 encoded.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "5VERv8NMvzbJMEkV8xnrLkEaWRtSz9CosKDYjCJjBRnbJLgp8uirBgmQpjKhoR4tjF3ZpRzrFmBV6UjKdiSZkQUW",
  "id": 1
}
```

This signature can then be used with `getTransaction` or a Solana explorer to track the status of the airdrop transaction.

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Request 1 SOL (1,000,000,000 lamports) to a Devnet address
# Replace <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> with an actual base-58 public key
# Ensure you are targeting a Devnet RPC URL
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "requestAirdrop",
    "params": [
      "<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>",
      1000000000
    ]
  }' \

# Request 0.5 SOL with "confirmed" commitment
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "requestAirdrop",
    "params": [
      "<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>",
      500000000,
      {
        "commitment": "confirmed"
      }
    ]
  }' \
  https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection, PublicKey, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getAirdrop(walletAddress) {
  // Connect to Devnet
  const connection = new Connection('https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>', 'confirmed');
  const publicKey = new PublicKey(walletAddress);

  try {
    console.log(`Requesting airdrop of 1 SOL to ${walletAddress} on Devnet...`);
    
    // Request an airdrop of 1 SOL
    const airdropSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
      publicKey,
      LAMPORTS_PER_SOL // 1 SOL
    );

    console.log(`Airdrop requested. Transaction signature: ${airdropSignature}`);

    // Confirm the transaction
    // Note: The `confirmTransaction` method in web3.js has evolved.
    // For newer versions, you might use `connection.confirmTransaction({ signature: airdropSignature, blockhash: latestBlockhash.blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight: latestBlockhash.lastValidBlockHeight }, 'confirmed');`
    // For simplicity, we'll log the signature and you can check on an explorer.
    // Or, more robustly, you can poll getSignatureStatuses.

    await connection.confirmTransaction(airdropSignature);
    console.log(`Airdrop successful for ${walletAddress}!`);

    const balance = await connection.getBalance(publicKey);
    console.log(`Current balance for ${walletAddress}: ${balance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} SOL`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error requesting airdrop for ${walletAddress}:`, error);
  }
}

// Replace with a Devnet wallet address you control
const myDevnetWallet = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEVNET_WALLET_ADDRESS'; 
// Example: const myDevnetWallet = new Keypair().publicKey.toBase58(); // For a new temporary wallet

if (myDevnetWallet === 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEVNET_WALLET_ADDRESS') {
  console.warn("Please replace 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEVNET_WALLET_ADDRESS' with an actual Devnet wallet address to run the example.");
} else {
  // getAirdrop(myDevnetWallet);
  console.log("Uncomment the line above and replace the placeholder to run the airdrop example.");
}
```

## Developer Tips

*   **Network Specific:** This method is only functional on test networks (Devnet, Testnet) that have a faucet enabled. It will fail on Mainnet Beta.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Airdrop faucets are often rate-limited to prevent abuse. If you make too many requests in a short period, you might receive errors.
*   **Amount Limits:** There might be limits on the amount of SOL you can request per airdrop or per time period.
*   **Confirmation:** After `requestAirdrop` returns a signature, the transaction still needs to be processed and confirmed by the network. You can use `confirmTransaction` (from `@solana/web3.js`) or poll `getSignatureStatuses` to wait for confirmation.
