The [`getBlocksWithLimit`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getblockswithlimit) RPC method allows you to retrieve a list of confirmed block slot numbers, starting from a specified slot and returning up to a given limit. This is useful when you need a specific number of subsequent confirmed blocks from a certain point in the ledger. For a general understanding of what blocks are in Solana, refer to [Understanding Slots, Blocks, and Epochs on Solana](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-slots-blocks-and-epochs).

## Common Use Cases

*   **Fetching a Fixed Number of Subsequent Blocks:** Get a defined number of block slots that were confirmed after a particular start slot.
*   **Paginated Block Exploration:** Retrieve blocks in chunks when analyzing a segment of the blockchain.
*   **Recent Block Monitoring:** Get the last N blocks from a known recent slot.

## Request Parameters

The `getBlocksWithLimit` method takes the following parameters:

1.  **`start_slot`** (u64, required): The first slot to consider (inclusive).
2.  **`limit`** (u64, required): The maximum number of block slots to return. The total number of slots queried (from `start_slot` up to `limit` blocks after it) **must not exceed 500,000 slots**.
3.  **`commitment`** (string, optional): Specifies the commitment level for the query. If omitted, the default commitment of the node is used. This is passed as the sole field in a configuration object as the last parameter.

## Response Structure

The `result` field of the JSON-RPC response will be an array of u64 integers. Each integer in the array represents a confirmed block slot number, starting from `start_slot` up to the specified `limit`.

*   Example: If `start_slot` is 5 and `limit` is 3, a possible result is `[5, 6, 7]`.

## Examples

### 1. Get a Limited Number of Blocks from a Start Slot

This example fetches a list of up to 5 confirmed block slots starting from slot `280000000`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBlocksWithLimit",
    "params": [
      280000000, 
      5 
    ]
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getBlocksWithLimitExample(startSlot, limit) {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const blocks = await connection.getBlocksWithLimit(startSlot, limit);
    console.log(`Up to ${limit} confirmed blocks starting from slot ${startSlot}:`, blocks);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching blocks with limit:', error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const startSlot = 280000000;
const limit = 5;
getBlocksWithLimitExample(startSlot, limit);
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Get Blocks With Limit and a Specific Commitment Level

This example fetches up to 3 blocks starting from slot `290000000` using the `confirmed` commitment level.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key> -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
  '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBlocksWithLimit",
    "params": [
      290000000,
      3,
      { "commitment": "confirmed" }
    ]
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript (using @solana/web3.js)
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

async function getBlocksWithLimitAndCommitment(startSlot, limit) {
  const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<api-key>');
  try {
    const blocks = await connection.getBlocksWithLimit(startSlot, limit, { commitment: 'confirmed' });
    console.log(`Up to ${limit} confirmed blocks (with 'confirmed' commitment) starting from slot ${startSlot}:`, blocks);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching blocks with limit and commitment:', error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const commitStartSlot = 290000000;
const commitLimit = 3;
getBlocksWithLimitAndCommitment(commitStartSlot, commitLimit);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Developer Tips

*   **Range Clarification:** The `limit` parameter dictates the maximum number of block *slots* to return. The 500,000 slot constraint applies to the conceptual range scanned (i.e., from `start_slot` to `start_slot + limit - 1`). Ensure this conceptual range doesn't exceed 500,000 slots, even if fewer actual blocks are found and returned within that range.
*   **Node Data Availability:** Nodes may not retain information for all historical slots. A very old `start_slot` might return fewer blocks than the specified `limit`, or an empty array, depending on the node's ledger retention.
*   **Block Confirmation:** This method returns *confirmed* blocks. The exact set of blocks can vary slightly depending on the chosen `commitment` level and which node you query, especially for very recent slots.
*   **Use Case Specificity:** `getBlocksWithLimit` is ideal when you know the starting point and need a fixed number of subsequent blocks. If you need all blocks in a known slot range, `getBlocks` might be more appropriate.

This guide provides a clear overview of how to use the `getBlocksWithLimit` RPC method to list a specific number of confirmed block slots on the Solana network.
