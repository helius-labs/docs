A common problem when working with RPCs or APIs on the client side is your API keys leaking.

Malicious actors can run up your [quota or rate limits](/billing/plans-and-rate-limits) if they get access to your keys.

Helius provides multiple options to protect your API keys:

## RPC Access Control Rules

You can configure access controls directly in your Helius dashboard to restrict who can use your endpoints:

<Frame caption="Configure RPC Access Control Rules in the Endpoints section of your dashboard.">
  <img src="/images/rpc-access-control-rules-ip-domain-cidr.webp" alt="Configure RPC Access Control Rules in the Endpoints section of your dashboard." />
</Frame>

Available rule types:

- **Allowed Domains**: Restrict access for your RPCs to specific domains that you enter here.
- **Allowed IPs**: Restrict access for your RPCs to specific IP addresses that you enter here.
- **Allowed CIDRs**: Restrict access for your RPCs to specific CIDR-notation IP ranges that you enter here.

## Secure URL Option

This URL hides your API key and is limited to 5 tps per IP. This is ideal for using in frontend applications where you don't want to worry about leaking your API key.

## Cloudflare RPC Proxy

For more advanced protection, using a proxy is the recommended solution.

We've setup a simple, open-source RPC proxy that you can deploy with 1-click to Cloudflare:

This proxy acts as a secure intermediary between your application and the Helius RPC, keeping your API key protected server-side.
