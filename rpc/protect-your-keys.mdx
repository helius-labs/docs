<Warning>
**API Key Security Alert**: Exposed API keys can lead to unauthorized usage, quota exhaustion, and unexpected charges. Always protect your keys in production applications.
</Warning>

## Why Key Protection Matters

When you expose API keys on the client side, malicious actors can discover and abuse them, potentially:

  <Card title="Exhaust Your Quota" icon="gauge-high">
    Malicious usage can quickly consume your API limits and cause service interruptions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increase Your Bills" icon="credit-card">
    Unauthorized requests can trigger auto-scaling charges or push you over plan limits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compromise Security" icon="shield-exclamation">
    Exposed keys can provide access to sensitive data and operations

## Protection Methods

Helius provides multiple layers of protection to secure your API keys:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RPC Proxy">
    Deploy your own proxy for maximum security and control.

    <Card title="Helius RPC Proxy" icon="github" href="https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-rpc-proxy">
      A simple, open-source RPC proxy that you can deploy with 1-click to Cloudflare.
    </Card>

    ### Benefits of Using a Proxy

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Complete Key Protection" icon="lock">
        Your API key stays server-side, never exposed to clients
      </Card>
      <Card title="Custom Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
        Implement your own rate limiting and usage controls
      </Card>
      <Card title="Request Filtering" icon="filter">
        Filter and validate requests before they reach Helius
      </Card>
      <Card title="Usage Analytics" icon="chart-line">
        Monitor and analyze your API usage patterns
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Access Control Rules">
    Configure precise access controls in your Helius dashboard to restrict API usage.

    </Frame>

    ### Available Rule Types

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Allowed Domains">
        Restrict access to specific domains - perfect for web applications.

        **Use cases:**
        - Production websites (`yourdapp.com`)
        - Development environments (`localhost:3000`)
        - Staging environments (`staging.yourdapp.com`)

        **Example configuration:**
        ```
        yourdapp.com
        www.yourdapp.com
        localhost:3000
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Allowed IPs">
        Restrict access to specific IP addresses - ideal for server applications.

        **Use cases:**
        - Backend servers with static IPs
        - CI/CD pipelines
        - Cloud-hosted services

        **Example configuration:**
        ```
        203.0.113.1
        198.51.100.42
        185.199.108.153
        ```

        <Note>
        Only public IP addresses work here. Private/local IPs (like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) won't work because they're behind NAT and the server only sees your public IP.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Allowed CIDRs">
        Restrict access to IP ranges using CIDR notation - great for enterprise networks.

        **Use cases:**
        - Corporate public IP ranges
        - Cloud provider IP ranges
        - Data center IP blocks

        **Example configuration:**
        ```
        203.0.113.0/24
        198.51.100.0/24
        185.199.108.0/22
        ```

        <Note>
        Only public IP ranges work here. Private CIDR blocks (192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12) won't work because they're behind NAT.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secure URL">
    Use our secure URL for frontend applications without exposing your API key.

    <Info>
    **Rate Limited**: Secure URLs are limited to 5 transactions per second (TPS) per IP address, making them perfect for frontend applications.
    </Info>

    ### How to Use Secure URLs

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Get Your Secure URL">
        Find your secure URL in the Helius dashboard under the RPCs section
      </Step>
      <Step title="Replace Your Regular RPC URL">
        Use the secure URL instead of your regular RPC URL with API key
      </Step>
      <Step title="No API Key Required">
        The secure URL doesn't require an API key parameter
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ```javascript
    // Instead of this (exposes API key):
    const connection = new Connection('https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY');

    // Use this (secure, no API key exposed):
    const connection = new Connection('https://your-secure-url.helius-rpc.com');
    ```

    <Note>
    **Perfect for**: Frontend applications, mobile apps, and any client-side code where you can't hide the API key.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="code">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code. Use environment variables instead.

    ```javascript
    // ❌ Don't do this
    const apiKey = "your-api-key-here";

    // ✅ Do this instead
    const apiKey = process.env.HELIUS_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Separate Keys for Different Environments" icon="layers">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments.

    ```javascript
    const getApiKey = () => {
      switch (process.env.NODE_ENV) {
        case 'production':
          return process.env.HELIUS_API_KEY_PROD;
        case 'staging':
          return process.env.HELIUS_API_KEY_STAGING;
        default:
          return process.env.HELIUS_API_KEY_DEV;
      }
    };
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Regular Key Rotation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Rotate your API keys regularly and immediately if you suspect they've been compromised.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate New Key">
        Create a new API key in your Helius dashboard
      </Step>
      <Step title="Update Applications">
        Update all applications to use the new key
      </Step>
      <Step title="Test Thoroughly">
        Ensure all services are working with the new key
      </Step>
      <Step title="Revoke Old Key">
        Delete the old key from your dashboard
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly check your API usage in the Helius dashboard for unusual patterns.

    **Red flags to watch for:**
    - Sudden spikes in usage
    - Requests from unexpected locations
    - High error rates
    - Usage during off-hours
