## What is Yellowstone gRPC?

Yellowstone gRPC provides **ultra-low latency streaming** of Solana blockchain data by tapping directly into Solana leaders to receive shreds as they're produced. This delivers real-time data to your application with minimal delay.

## How to Access Yellowstone gRPC

<Note>
Choose the option that best fits your needs:

**[LaserStream](/laserstream/)** - Multi-tenant, highly available gRPC service with automatic failover and historical replay capabilities. Ideal for most production applications.

**[Dedicated Nodes](/dedicated-nodes/)** - Exclusive gRPC endpoint with guaranteed resource isolation. Best for specialized requirements.

**Need help deciding?** See our [detailed comparison guide](/laserstream/laserstream-vs-dedicated-nodes) to understand which option is right for your use case.

## Subscription Request Structure

Every gRPC subscription requires a properly structured request. Here's how to build one:

### Core Parameters

<ParamField path="commitment" type="string" required>
  **Commitment level for data consistency**
  
  - `processed` - Transaction processed by the node
  - `confirmed` - Transaction confirmed by cluster  
  - `finalized` - Transaction finalized by cluster
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ping" type="boolean" optional>
  **Keep connection alive**
  
  Set to `true` to receive pong messages every 15 seconds, preventing connection timeouts from load balancers or proxies.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="accounts_data_slice" type="array" optional>
  **Optimize data transfer**
  
  Request specific byte ranges from account data:
  ```json
  [
    { "offset": 0, "length": 100 },
    { "offset": 200, "length": 50 }
  ]
  ```
</ParamField>

### Filter Configuration

<Accordion title="Account Filters">
  <ParamField path="account" type="array<string>">
    Array of account public keys to monitor (logical OR)
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="owner" type="array<string>">
    Array of owner public keys to monitor (logical OR)  
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="filters" type="array<object>">
    DataSize and Memcmp filters (logical AND):
    ```json
    [
      { "dataSize": 165 },
      { "memcmp": { "offset": 0, "bytes": "base58_encoded_bytes" } }
    ]
    ```
  </ParamField>
  
  <Info>
    When multiple filter types are used, they operate as logical AND. Within arrays, values operate as logical OR.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Filters">
  <ParamField path="vote" type="boolean">
    Include/exclude vote transactions
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="failed" type="boolean">
    Include/exclude failed transactions
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="signature" type="string">
    Monitor specific transaction signature
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="account_include" type="array<string>">
    Include transactions involving any of these accounts (logical OR)
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="account_exclude" type="array<string>">
    Exclude transactions involving any of these accounts
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="account_required" type="array<string>">
    Include transactions involving all of these accounts (logical AND)
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Block Filters">
  <ParamField path="account_include" type="array<string>">
    Filter transactions and accounts within blocks
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="include_transactions" type="boolean">
    Include all transactions within the block
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="include_accounts" type="boolean">
    Include all account updates within the block
  </ParamField>
  
  <ParamField path="include_entries" type="boolean">
    Include all entries within the block
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slot Filters">
  <ParamField path="filter_by_commitment" type="boolean" default="false">
    When `true`, only receive slot updates for the specified commitment level. When `false`, receive updates for all commitment levels.
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

## Example: Basic Transaction Monitoring

Here's a complete example to get you started:

```typescript
import Client, { CommitmentLevel, SubscribeRequest } from "@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc";

const client = new Client("your-grpc-endpoint", "your-api-token", {
  "grpc.max_receive_message_length": 64 * 1024 * 1024
});

const stream = await client.subscribe();

// Handle incoming data
stream.on("data", (data) => {
  if (data.transaction) {
    console.log(`Transaction: ${data.transaction.signature}`);
    console.log(`Success: ${!data.transaction.meta?.err}`);
  }
});

// Subscribe to transactions with complete request structure
const subscribeRequest: SubscribeRequest = {
  transactions: {
    client: {
      accountInclude: [
        "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA", // Token Program
        "11111111111111111111111111111111"               // System Program
      ],
      accountExclude: [],
      accountRequired: [],
      vote: false,
      failed: false
    }
  },
  commitment: CommitmentLevel.CONFIRMED,
  ping: { id: 1 }
};

stream.write(subscribeRequest);
```

<Note>
This is a basic example. For production use, implement proper error handling, reconnection logic, and data processing. See our detailed guides for complete implementations.
