## Introduction

Laserstream is a multi-protocol streaming service for Solana that delivers real-time data (transactions, slots, blocks, accounts, etc.) without requiring a dedicated node. It's designed to serve as a near drop-in replacement for existing Solana streaming solutions, requiring minimal configuration changes.

### **Key Highlights**

* **Multiple Protocol Support**: gRPC, Enhanced WebSockets, and standard Solana WebSockets.
* **Historical Replay**: Automatically backfills data if you disconnect, ensuring you never miss critical updates.
* **Never Lag Behind**: Aggregates data from multiple nodes, so you stay synced with Solana's high throughput.
* **Easy Setup**: Dedicated client libraries and straightforward configuration.
* **Extreme Availability**: Each Laserstream worker is backed by multiple RPC nodes, deployed across multiple clusters for failover.

## Supported Protocols

You can choose whichever protocol (or combination) best suits your application's needs:

### **gRPC**

High-performance streaming interface (via Helius Laserstream client or the Yellowstone library).

#### **Enhanced WebSocket**

Offering faster response times than standard Solana WebSockets, with specialized subscription methods (`transactionSubscribe`, `accountSubscribe`).

### **WebSocket**

Standard approach aligned with Solana's stable WebSocket methods, but augmented by Helius's infrastructure.

<Info>
We suggest using **gRPC** for backend applications due to its high performance, low latency, and robust streaming capabilities. However, since gRPC is a binary protocol and not readily supported in most browsers, **WebSockets**—either Enhanced or standard—are recommended for frontend use.

***

Laserstream gives you the freedom to choose the **streaming protocol**—gRPC, Enhanced WebSockets, or standard Solana WebSockets—that best fits your application. Combined with our multi-node infrastructure, historical replay, and failover capabilities, you can confidently build real-time Solana applications without worrying about data gaps or lag.
